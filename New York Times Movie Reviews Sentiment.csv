1,11/8/2016,11/1/2017,11/2/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/11-8-16-review.html,,0,"Spoiler alerts would be superfluous in a review of “11/8/16”: You already know the ending, and you’ve lived through the events. Nevertheless, this documentary generates ample tension as it views the last Election Day through the eyes of more than 16 people, following them during their mornings and afternoons then waiting with them for the results that night.
The diverse group includes Anthony, a former prisoner in Alabama, exonerated and voting for the first time in decades; Eric, a coal miner, and his family in West Virginia; Johnny, a union leader in Philadelphia; Calene, a mother of six in Utah who is supporting an independent presidential candidate; and others from California, Ohio and elsewhere.
We watch them at barber shops, playgrounds and dinner tables, and hear political opinions that seem prescient or misguided in retrospect. When the polls close, emotions roller coaster as the confident turn frustrated and the uncertain become enthusiastic. Many of these voters’ decisions are based on seemingly incomplete information and broad generalities. Some of their outlooks are naïve, others inspiring.
Eighteen directors are credited with the footage; Jeff Deutchman, who is listed as the curator, previously curated “11/4/08,” an examination of that Election Day. The editing here, by Jon Lefkovitz and Martha Shane, sets a speedy pace and keeps the focus on the voters rather than on Clinton and Trump, who are seldom seen.
Considering all that’s been written and said over the last year, there’s not much new to learn from “11/8/16.” But the film remains engaging for its stories, and is likely to be more instructive in the future, when passions have cooled. Judging by most people here, that won’t be soon.",0.988875393,Documentary
2,1945,11/1/2017,10/31/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/movies/1945-review-ferenc-torok.html,,0,"The men in hats arrive by train and slowly walk the dusty road toward the village, following the horse-drawn flatbed that carries their cargo. The stationmaster bicycles ahead of them to issue a warning at the watering hole; the residents begin to whisper. It’s the wedding day of the son of the town clerk, who doesn’t want any trouble with elections coming up. The wedding itself seems like a shaky affair, with an uneasy groom and a bride whose previous fiancé is still hovering.
Ferenc Torok’s lean, suggestive Hungarian feature, “1945,” shot in gorgeous, high-contrast black-and-white, is a Holocaust film built, consciously or not, on a reversal of the tropes of the western, down to ticking clocks that might as well be nearing high noon. The visiting men in black hats — a father (Ivan Angelus) and his adult son (Marcell Nagy) — aren’t villains out for revenge, but Orthodox Jews, who have come to the village at the end of the war. They are transporting trunks said to be filled with perfume or cosmetics. The purpose of their journey is obscure.
The two barely speak over the course of the film; the guilty villagers talk among themselves. “We have to give it all back,” the town drunk (Jozsef Szarvas) tells the clerk, Istvan (Peter Rudolf), believing that the strangers have a connection to the town’s deported Jews. Dismissing the concern, Istvan nevertheless understands that fear; he played a pivotal role in betraying the local Jews, a sin for which his opiate-addicted wife (Eszter Nagy-Kalozy) holds him in contempt. As the film slowly reveals how the village’s veneer of civility is built over a foundation of treachery, the darkened foregrounds suggest conspirators hiding in plain sight.
Absorbing and finely wrought, “1945” is not perfect. It oversimplifies Istvan’s motivation for issuing an accusation against a friend. The modernist-style score by Tibor Szemzo is more distracting than atmospheric, especially when it riffs on Max Bruch’s widely used composition for Kol Nidre, a Yom Kippur prayer that seems inappropriate for this particular context. And by design, the movie is something of a tease, more interested in setup than in payoff. The guilt that eats at these characters resists easy closure or absolution.",0.948856259,Drama
3,78/52,10/13/2017,10/12/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/78-52-hitchcocks-shower-scene-review.html,,1,"In 2000, the critic Andrew Sarris, one of the original champions of “Psycho,” wrote of how a student had spotted a hidden meaning in Hitchcock’s editing of a scene with Sheriff Chambers (John McIntire). He credited the student with having given him a fresh eye on a film he thought he knew backward and forward.
One testament to the infinite richness of Hitchcock’s 1960 masterpiece is that it can sustain a film like Alexandre O. Philippe’s documentary “78/52: Hitchcock’s Shower Scene.” Although “78/52” discusses the significance of “Psycho” as a whole, Mr. Philippe’s movie is primarily devoted to a close reading of just one sequence: the 78 camera setups and 52 edits that yielded the sudden, violent, waterlogged demise of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Even moviegoers who know “Psycho” backward and forward — who consider it a sacred text and who have read Stephen Rebello’s excellent book “Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ‘Psycho’” — are bound to learn something new from the movie, which addresses the shower scene from critical, historical, theoretical and technical angles, down to the blinding white of the bathroom tiles.
Many of the original cast and crew members are no longer alive and are featured only in archival interviews, although seeing Marli Renfro, the pinup model who served as Janet Leigh’s body double, is a special treat. Much of the movie’s appeal lies in the more off-kilter observations: The curator Timothy Standring discusses the particular version of “Susanna and the Elders” that hangs over Norman Bates’s peephole and notes that, of all the renditions of that scene, the one Hitchcock used strongly connotes voyeurism. Guillermo del Toro expounds on how the shower scene expresses Hitchcock’s Catholic sense of guilt — it shows Marion, who has committed adultery and theft, trying to cleanse herself of a sin that can’t be washed away.
But given that the shower scene is perhaps the most brilliantly edited sequence in movie history, it’s no surprise that the editors have much to say. Walter Murch, who took part in creating a tribute to the shower scene in “The Conversation,” annotates portions of Hitchcock’s sequence cut by cut. Amy E. Duddleston, the editor of Gus Van Sant’s 1998 not-quite replica of a remake, looks at the differences between the original and her version, pondering why hers didn’t play. Mr. Rebello relays a funny anecdote (also in his book) about how Hitchcock selected just the right variety of melon — casaba — to mimic the sound of a knife piercing flesh.
Not all the interviews are equally sharp (it’s not clear why Elijah Wood had to be here), and it’s easy to tell who is dabbling and who has pored over the sequence again and again to understand its effect. It’s a screen moment to treat with total reverence — and so enduring it could sustain “78/52: Part 2.”",0.953922133,Documentary
4,A Bad Moms Christmas,11/1/2017,11/2/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/a-bad-moms-christmas.html,R,0,"Opposed as I am to sequels of any description, I have to allow that one can never have enough Kathryn Hahn. Add the magnificent Christine Baranski to the mix and “A Bad Moms Christmas,” while still a slog of base sight gags and lazy profanity, becomes marginally more bearable.
Only marginally, given that this pitiful follow-up to last year’s “Bad Moms” is even less able to distinguish between crass and comedic. (To the writers and directors, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, they’re apparently the same thing.) Adding an extra schmear of bad mothers, the plot finds our three originals (Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Ms. Hahn) buckling under the stress of Christmas and appalled when their own mothers (played by Ms. Baranski, Cheryl Hines and Susan Sarandon) show up for the holiday.
The new arrivals, complete with a single neurosis apiece — the grifter, the clinger, the perfectionist — infantilize and infuriate their daughters, who vow to “take back Christmas.” This rebellion, staged in raucous montages in a mall and elsewhere, involves getting plastered at the food court, terrorizing Santa with cleavage and assaulting strangers and one another. Worst of all is an extended sequence where Ms. Hahn’s character gives a Brazilian wax to a prodigiously endowed male client, who verbally guides us from stem to stern with disgusting specificity. At the same time, the movie’s presumably normally gifted men are as superfluous to the proceedings as a thesaurus in the writers’ room.
Set in a suburban nightmare of oppressive expectations, “A Bad Moms Christmas” ends with its own sequel already cued up.
“I have heart cancer,” Ms. Hines’s character says at one point in a vain attempt to halt her daughter’s complaints. I think I know exactly what she meant.",0.004272824,Action

Mr. Crowley made a concept trailer that appeared online in 2012 and garnered a huge following. But despite signs of progress, the film never happened. Mr. Crowley was found dead in January 2015, along with his wife and daughter, in what police concluded was a double homicide and suicide: He had shot his family and then himself. Perhaps because Mr. Crowley was drawn to the paranoid fringe (he is shown meeting and watching Alex Jones), the deaths became a cause for conspiracy theorists.
The documentary’s director, Erik Nelson (a producer on “Grizzly Man”), explores the disjunction between the charismatic filmmaker-to-be with a penchant for both self-promotion and self-documentation and a man who was, it eventually seems clear, descending into mental illness. In one scene that captures the apparent duality of Mr. Crowley, the movie features an interview with two entertainment executives who speak enthusiastically about a meeting with him. Mr. Nelson then shows them as they listen to audio recorded beforehand in which Mr. Crowley describes plans to manipulate them.
There’s a morbid fascination inherent to documentaries like “A Gray State,” which is engrossing for the reasons it’s also unsatisfying: As Adam Shambour, a friend of Mr. Crowley’s, says, it’s a mystery that answers all the major questions except “Why?”",0.295837585,Documentary
6,Aida's Secrets,10/20/2017,10/19/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/aidas-secrets-review.html,,1,"Directed by Alon and Shaul Schwarz, “Aida’s Secrets” chronicles one man’s late-in-life search for his brother, from whom he was separated as a toddler at the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp after World War II. But the remarkable tale it tells — of a family split up and dispersed to different continents, and the detective work required to figure out what had happened — turns this documentary into a fascinating mystery of reshuffled identities. In this time of mass displacement across the globe, it is a stark reminder of how traumatic the refugee experience often is.
At 3, Izak Szewelewicz was sent by his mother, Aida, to Israel from Bergen-Belsen to be raised by foster parents. “It was the best I could do,” she says simply when interviewed. Aida herself immigrated to Canada and would visit Izak on rare occasions. But she never told him that he had a younger brother, or that his father had taken the brother but that she didn’t know where. Izak learned of this when he was 67, in 2013. The Schwarzes, Izak’s nephews, assisted him while filming this unfolding account.
With the help of investigators and archives in Europe, Canada and Israel, Izak meets his brother, Shepsel, who is blind and living in Winnipeg. But the teary reunion and Shepsel’s first nervous meeting with Aida are just the start. As Izak and Shepsel try to assemble their family history, questions abound. Friends of Aida recount bits of background she had shared. At 89, though, Aida remains evasive: She doesn’t recall that man with her and the boys in that Bergen-Belsen photo; she’s fuzzy on why she moved to Canada without Shepsel and his father. The film is called “Aida’s Secrets” for good reason.",0.925442096,Documentary

Yet the director, Marc Forster (who wrote the script with Sean Conway), fashions such a languid, tipsy aesthetic around the seemingly happy marriage of Gina and James (Blake Lively and Jason Clarke) that it’s easy to keep watching. Legally blind since childhood, Gina rarely leaves their home in Bangkok, relying almost entirely on the attentive James. But when a cornea transplant restores vision to one eye, Gina discovers that her life is not quite as she imagined.
Nor is she. New erotic interests surface during a trip to Spain, where the hypersexualized marriage of her sister and brother-in-law nudges the film into seamier territory and prompts a change in Gina’s appearance. As James becomes increasingly destabilized by his wife’s transformation, the movie seems keen to linger over what can happen to a relationship when a previously dependent partner gains agency.
Instead, we’re hastened toward a nonsensical, almost illegible ending that lays waste to all this careful mood-setting. Ms. Lively is well cast, gracefully patrolling the boundary of her limited range, with Mr. Clarke less steady in the more amorphous role of someone who seems a bit off from the outset. And though the milky visual disruptions that signal Gina’s initially blurry view of the world are overdone, there’s something seductive about her journey that cries out for a filmmaker like Nicolas Roeg. In his hands, the haze of sex and danger that surrounds these two might have been revealed as more than just a tease.",0.369054927,Drama

It does not apply, however, to Satya de la Manitou, the self-described “right-hand man” to the actor and filmmaker Dennis Hopper for over 40 years and the onscreen narrator of “Along for the Ride.” His reverence for his friend infuses this documentary, shot in somber, stately black and white (except for color clips).
He interviews many of Hopper’s friends and associates, including the art dealer Tony Shafrazi and the actor and filmmaker Dean Stockwell, with whom Hopper so memorably appeared in David Lynch’s “Blue Velvet.”
Mr. de la Manitou met Hopper in New Mexico when he was flush with the success of “Easy Rider” (1969) and had persuaded Universal Pictures to fund a metafictional art film called “The Last Movie.” The editing of that movie, in Taos, became the subject of its own documentary, “The American Dreamer” (1971), which seems to depict Mr. Hopper going mad. “The Last Movie,” as hermetically brilliant as it is indulgent, was a huge commercial failure that resulted in Mr. Hopper’s near-exile from Hollywood. Mr. de la Manitou followed.
“Along for the Ride,” directed by Nick Ebeling, does not ignore Hopper’s wild side. Mr. de la Manitou tells of Hopper alienating Taos locals and sassing cops in bars as if these were heroic acts. But Hopper here is an artist as tortured as he was torturing, as if the director is trying to redress some imbalance.
As moving as Mr. de la Manitou’s testimony sometimes is, this movie too often feels like a credulity-straining attempt at hagiography.",0.609452815,Documentary
9,Bitch,11/10/2017,11/9/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/movies/bitch-review.html,,1,"When we meet Jill (Marianna Palka), the distraught mother at the center of “Bitch,” she’s on her dining table attempting to hang herself from a light fixture. Outside, the frantic sound of barking dogs fills her leafy suburb; inside, the ceaseless demands of four children and a callously philandering husband, Bill (Jason Ritter), render her pain invisible.
Like the great Mary Chapin Carpenter song “He Thinks He’ll Keep Her,” “Bitch” is about a woman who has reached the end of her leash. A satirical scream of rage against patriarchal prerogatives, this feminist horror-comedy, written and directed by Ms. Palka, has a vicious edge that can stifle your laughter. So when Jill takes to her basement, snarling and covered in her own feces, her belief that she’s the dog her family seems to think she is comes across as more tragic than funny.
The title, though, has a dual meaning; and it’s in Bill’s furiously baffled response to his wife’s abandonment of her parental responsibilities that the movie finds its footing and its humor. As she did in her gentler but equally original “Good Dick” in 2008, Ms. Palka carves a black and biting niche between a man and a woman, a space where chaos and psychological unease demand to be reckoned with. Emphasizing this, Morgan Z. Whirledge’s dense and darting score builds an atmosphere of unnerving upheaval — essential to a movie relying on mood rather than special effects.
Eventually losing momentum (but not its fealty to Jill’s desperation), “Bitch” leans heavily on Mr. Ritter’s energetic grounding of its bizarre premise. Alternately manic and maddened, Bill is like a red flag to overly smug husbands, wildly warning of the comeuppance to come.",0.581274231,Comedy
10,Blade of the Immortal,11/3/2017,11/2/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/blade-of-the-immortal-review-takashi-miike.html,R,0,"If there’s one constant in samurai movies, it’s that their heroes are ridiculously hard to kill, battling on through every assault short of being blown to smithereens. Imagine, then, how much tougher to dispatch is a samurai whose wounds — the physical ones, anyway — heal themselves, and you have a fair idea of the sheer volume of damage visited on Manji (Takuya Kimura), the justifiably grumpy centerpiece of Takashi Miike’s “Blade of the Immortal.”
Adding a soupçon of sorcery to the genre’s typical vengeance saga, Manji’s immortality effectively embellishes the slice-and-dice dust-ups that propel the plot and punctuate Tetsuya Oishi’s screenplay. (As it happens, Manji can be rubbed out, just exceedingly slowly — like, over years.) Based on the eponymous long-running manga series by Hiroaki Samura, the story opens on a stunning black-and-white battle that leaves Manji mortally wounded and his little sister slain.
Out of nowhere, an ancient crone appears and stuffs sacred worms into his wounds. Like slimy paramedics, the creatures rejoin his gashes and gloppily reattach his severed hand, but Manji feels more cursed than blessed. And when the movie leaps 50 years ahead and bursts into color we find him scarred, reclusive and not at all eager to help a young girl named Rin (Hana Sugisaki) avenge the murder of her parents. But Rin looks exactly like his sister, and a “True Grit” connection develops that will send them on one of the bloodiest quests in samurai history.
It’s also one of the most bonkers. Single-handedly facing down a succession of riverine hordes, Manji also has to dodge ultra-colorful weaponry — like blades cunningly designed to relocate your insides to your outsides — and an array of fancifully coifed and costumed lone opponents. These include a lithe young swordswoman, bravely defying the constraints of a purple maxi skirt and platform sandals; a masked monster with dead heads strapped to his shoulders; a fellow immortal who’s 200 years old and ready to die after seeing five wives to their graves. (A conservative number, I thought, for two centuries.)
Though not nearly as mindful or meaty as Mr. Miike’s 2011 triumph, “13 Assassins,” “Blade” is creatively gory fun. Overlong and over-the-top, the brutality finally becomes repetitive and somewhat deadening; but Mr. Miike has learned a few tricks from his many previous movies, like allowing the camera to sit still and capture the eerie silence that follows a massacre.
That stillness is a trademark of Anotsu (Sota Fukushi, terrific), the story’s big bad and also its most beautiful. Languid and slender, with an androgynous pout and a fondness for palest turquoise, the soft-voiced Anotsu leads his renegade army primarily by standing and posing. He doesn’t need to scream or gesticulate; the whole world is his runway.",0.855036587,Action

After contracting the disease in the 1950s at the age of 28, Cavendish, paralyzed from the neck down and expected to live only a few months, not only beat those odds by almost 40 years, but regained his independence. He was also instrumental in helping other severely disabled patients regain theirs, collaborating with his friend Teddy (Hugh Bonneville), an amateur inventor, to design a wheelchair with a built-in ventilator and traveling to Europe to promote its use.
This exceptional life, however, is smothered by a cloying fairy tale romance that turns every challenge the couple faces into a lark. (Silly dog, unplugging Daddy’s breathing machine!) Their charmed existence includes a huge country house, a free nanny and friends who are forever popping over for wine-soaked parties. Not even a broken respirator, which strands the family on a Spanish roadside, can halt the fun: Within minutes, an impromptu fiesta, complete with guitarists and flamenco dancers, has materialized to keep them company.
Offering no hint of the backbreaking drudgery and mental strain of their predicament, this gauzy picture (produced by the couple’s son, Jonathan Cavendish, and directed by his friend, the actor Andy Serkis) is a closed loop of rose-tinted memories. Similarly constrained, Mr. Garfield smiles broadly through episodes of near-suffocation and bloody sputum, while Ms. Foy embodies the buck-up-and-carry-on mentality that William Nicholson’s screenplay demands.
In only one scene do we feel genuinely moved, as Robin and Diana visit a German hospital where polio patients are housed in a futuristic nightmare of iron-lung efficiency. It’s a rebel moment of chillingly authentic horror that seems to have slipped through every bad-feeling filter the filmmakers have installed. For a movie about an extraordinary couple who rarely played it safe, “Breathe” is all too content to do just that.",0.338318756,Biography

The delay probably explains why the film takes nearly 40 minutes to deliver a glorified walk-on from Melissa McCarthy, who wasn’t nearly as major a star when it was made, or why she and the other well-known actors look about a decade younger.
Like the can that got lost in the pantry and is now showing telltales of botulism risk, this misbegotten mockumentary, directed by Guy Shalem and Cathryn Michon (though only Mr. Shalem was credited in 2007), hasn’t been improved by time. The movie tries to do for amateur cooking contests what “Best in Show” did for dog competitions, but the strained folksiness and tired stereotypes couldn’t be further from the snap and wit of prime Christopher Guest.
The contestants include Sharon (Ms. Michon) and Pauline (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a pair of sisters from Minnesota. Sharon is engaged to a closeted African-American Lutheran (Gary Anthony Williams) whose mere existence the movie seems to regard as humorous.
In a film with no shortage of wacky food names (“that-time-of-the-month crab puffs”) or kitchen disasters, Pauline’s creamed corn for the lactose intolerant is the only recipe that sounds remotely edible. What Ms. McCarthy does with sweet potatoes and way too many marshmallows is more likely to elicit a retch than a laugh — and suggests a culinary correlative to the way “Cook Off!” has been slapped together.",0.123165744,Comedy

The original concerned the rivalry between Dusty (Mark Wahlberg), a globe-trotting macho man of mystery, and Brad (Will Ferrell), the teary, trying-too-hard stepfather married to Dusty’s ex-wife, Sara (Linda Cardellini), and helping to raise Dusty’s children. At the start of “Daddy’s Home 2,” the now-buddies have figured out a way to share parenting duties.
When their own fathers arrive for Christmas, several barely disguised gags from the first movie repeat. Don (John Lithgow) proves as cringingly lovey-dovey as his son, Brad; Kurt (Mel Gibson), Dusty’s father, is a crass repository of growls, backslaps and chauvinist remarks. Kurt’s only trait that doesn’t scream “Gibson” is that he is supposed to be a former astronaut.
To punch up the families’ winter holiday, Kurt books an impromptu getaway on Airbnb. You might think the late reservation is the setup for a joke, but no, it’s just product placement.

But behind the facade of a self-assured showman is the secret Mr. Turner tries to keep to himself: He’s blind.
Mr. Turner, 63, had rebelled in his youth against the grim prognosis that he would one day lose his eyesight. From his love of TV westerns, he learned the sleights of hand used by cardsharps. Then with an obsessive — and sometimes reckless — energy, he made a career as one of the foremost card magicians in his field, performing at the Magic Castle nightclub in Hollywood, at magic conventions and on TV talk shows.
As confident as he appears when shuffling a deck of cards, Mr. Turner remains at odds with his blindness. In a few TV appearances, awkward moments arise when the host clumsily refers to Mr. Turner’s disability before he can illustrate his strength as an illusionist. In candid interviews, he’s open about his discomfort around strangers showering him with sympathy and his attempts to hide his blindness in public by refusing to use a cane or a guide dog.
Mr. Korem keeps a reverent distance from his subject, as if not to spoil the magic. The director is either too polite or too timid to push Mr. Turner to reveal more details than he’s comfortable sharing. Such a dynamic personality as Mr. Turner’s could use a more dynamic documentary to illuminate it. As it is, “Dealt” remains a pleasing — if inoffensive — portrait.",0.947435981,Documentary

Levine and Landon Van Soest, grew out of a People magazine article from 2011 about the Innovative Concept Academy, an alternative school in St. Louis designed to rehabilitate teenagers who might otherwise be incarcerated. The film follows one such student over about two years.
The movie begins with Daje Shelton, known as Boonie, then 17, visiting a courtroom after a school fight. The judge, Jimmie M. Edwards, who opened the academy, tells her that he will decide whether to lock her up. The alternative school is her last option for getting a high school diploma, he says. She won’t be able to attend other public schools in Missouri.
“For Ahkeem” trails Boonie as she tries to graduate. It’s not clear that she will pass the necessary coursework. Her apparent apathy toward school seems, in part, like the product of a bleak upbringing filled with poverty and street violence. She casually rattles off the names of dead friends (“too many to count”). Boonie also has a boyfriend, which leads to complications that shouldn’t be spoiled.
The filming period coincided with the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and a grand jury’s decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the officer who shot him. The protests are mainly a backdrop to Boonie’s story, though. While the film ends at a logical stopping point, it feels incomplete.

The documentary “Frank Serpico” fills out an American classic that is now almost 45 years old. “Serpico,” the 1973 movie directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino, was an adaptation of a book by Peter Maas about a New York City police officer who fought corruption in the ranks and got, among other things, a bullet in the head for his trouble. The real-life subject is now 81 years old, whippet-thin, and a storyteller and self-examiner of no small gifts.
Whenever Mr. Serpico appears in this admiring film, directed by Antonino D’Ambrosio, the movie lights up. “I told myself I was an actor,” he says into a mirror onscreen, describing how he would work himself up before hitting the streets to make arrests. He recalls, speaking from the restaurant in Brooklyn that used to be his father’s shoe-repair store, how even in childhood his admiration for police work was mitigated by experience. Once, he says, a uniformed officer came into the place, got a shoeshine from Frank, who was then a child, and left without paying. Next time, Frank’s father demanded payment upfront. “The cop never came into the store again,” Mr. Serpico says. “Although he had the shield of the law, he demeaned it by his actions.”
Mr. Serpico joined the force in 1959 and, witnessing casual payoffs that were accepted without a thought, encountered further disappointment: “The job was not on the level.”
The star of the movie is a compelling figure, and Mr. D’Ambrosio presents quite a few people from Mr. Serpico’s past who have a similar draw. But the director’s filmmaking instincts are not always salutary. He introduces each new interviewee with a shot of the subject standing, looking into the camera for several seconds. This affectation grows wearying. The actor John Turturro is not an uninteresting subject, but watching him talk about his reaction to the Lumet-Pacino movie, you get the feeling he is only there because Mr. D’Ambrosio could not secure an on-camera interview with Mr. Pacino.
The movie does feature a sit-down between Mr. Serpico and Arthur Cesare, his partner in the narcotics division, who was present the night Mr. Serpico was shot. He tells Mr. Cesare that he considers it peculiar that no 10-13, or “officer in need of assistance,” call went out on his behalf. But there’s no combustion in the confrontation, and the exchange goes limp. Could Mr. Cesare have called it in, and if so, why didn’t he? Like much else in the movie, it’s frustrating.",0.244345813,Documentary

But of course I don’t have a choice. Mr. Butler’s character, Jake Lawson, has a job to do, and so do I. Jake’s is to fix the space-based weather-control system he designed and built, racing against a digital clock that counts down the minutes until “geostorm.” Mine involves counting the minutes until “Geostorm” is over and then offering a comprehensive damage assessment. To quote something Jake says to a grandstanding senator (Richard Schiff) who dares to question his expertise: you’re welcome.
Directed by Dean Devlin from a script he wrote with Paul Guyot and discreetly installed in theaters without advance screenings, “Geostorm” uses digital technology to lay waste to a bunch of cities and hacky screenwriting to assault the dignity of several fine actors. Andy Garcia and Ed Harris are the president and secretary of state, while Abbie Cornish is a Secret Service agent secretly keeping company with a deputy secretary named Max Lawson (Jim Sturgess) who happens to be Jake’s younger brother. The siblings have their differences, but they share an unplaceable American accent, an aversion to regular shaving and a desire not to see the world destroyed by ice, fire, hail or heavy rain.
The movie does what it can to replicate those elemental forces. I happened to see it in the 4DX format — a first for me — which combines the thrill of a Mad Tea Party ride with the sensory challenges of a cab ride across the Manhattan Bridge on a rainy night. Your seat rocks and rumbles during chase scenes, lists gently from side to side during zero-gravity interludes and abuses your lumbar spine when space junk starts flying. You sometimes catch a whiff of burning skyscraper, a spray of monsoon mist, a whoosh of gale-force wind and the gentle caress of Mr. Butler’s stubble on your cheek.
Not that last thing, actually, but I’m sure they’re working on it. And I look forward to future 4DX adventures, or at least to installing one of those chairs in my office. I wouldn’t say the experience improved “Geostorm,” but it certainly didn’t make it any worse. As for Mr. Butler, he is no more or less credible as a renegade scientific genius than in any other role he’s attempted; consistency is his chief and perhaps his only virtue as an actor. He does his job. I do mine. The world is safe. The weather is fine.",0.838389169,Action

Like Johnny (Josh O’Connor), who labors on his struggling family farm in Yorkshire under the critical eyes of his sick father (Ian Hart) and stolid grandmother (Gemma Jones). For relief, he vents his frustrations in binge-drinking and furtive, feral sex with random young men.
These taciturn encounters, unfolding as unsentimentally as the internal exam he gives a pregnant heifer, suggest someone disgusted by his own sorry self. But this bracing, sometimes brutal movie — the feature debut of the writer and director Francis Lee — doesn’t present Johnny’s sexuality as the cause of his self-loathing. Rather, it’s his imprisonment by a legacy he’s not sure he wants that ties his tongue and clots his emotions.
Both are about to be loosened. The arrival of Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu), a gentle, darkly handsome Romanian migrant worker, softens Johnny’s heart and the movie’s tone. Their passion isn’t pretty, but awkward and pasty and explicit: two frantic strangers grappling in the muck of the moors. Yet Gheorghe is skilled at handling more than newborn lambs; and as the men grow closer, the glowering light grows warmer and the whole picture seems to briefly exhale.
Filmed with a naturalism that recalls Andrea Arnold’s 2012 dive into “Wuthering Heights,” “God’s Own Country” weaves a rough magic from Joshua James Richards’s biting cinematography and the story’s slow, unsteady arc from bitter to hopeful. Bodily fluids — bestial and human — stain the screen, punctuating a story that’s as much about rediscovering place as finding love. So when Gheorghe looks out at the brooding countryside and murmurs “It’s beautiful here,” we sense that Johnny really doesn’t need persuading.",0.944860636,Drama

The person in need of improvement is Tree (an unimprovable Jessica Rothe), a selfish sorority sister who’s mean to her perfectly nice roommate and much too friendly with her married professor. Waking up on her birthday in a strange man’s dorm room after a supposed one night stand, she stumbles through her day until, en route to her surprise party that night, she is brutally murdered by a masked attacker. Unfortunately, she’s about to experience this particular day again — multiple times.
Niftily paced and tight as a chokehold, the script (by the comic-book writer Scott Lobdell) delivers just enough variation to hold our interest. The means of Tree’s expirations are unoriginal and not especially scary, but the director, Christopher Landon, maintains a breezy momentum while she wakes, runs, croaks and repeats. With each resurrection, she’s in slightly worse shape, but marginally better-tempered, giving Ms. Rothe room to deepen the character and arc from unsympathetic victim to loving girlfriend.
Rarely out of our sight, Ms. Rothe is inexhaustible and funny, with Israel Broussard a perfect foil as her bemused, sweetly bland love interest. But it’s the newcomer Rachel Matthews as Danielle, the snippy sorority president, who’s the natural comedian. Encased in preppy separates and armed with withering put-downs, Danielle is every bit as deadly as any campus killer.",0.484635514,Horror
20,Hello Again,11/8/2017,11/7/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/movies/hello-again-review.html,,0,"In recent years, the movie musical has struggled for its complete resurrection as a genre, in efforts ranging from the Hollywood high-flown (“Into the Woods”) to the modest and quirky (Jeffrey St. Jules’s little-seen “Bang Bang Baby,” from 2014). And now, somewhere between the two, lies “Hello Again,” Tom Gustafson’s florid adaptation of Michael John LaChiusa’s 1993 Off Broadway show (itself based on Arthur Schnitzler’s “La Ronde”). What most distinguishes “Hello Again” from the others is its cast of New York theater powerhouses, including Martha Plimpton, Audra McDonald and Cheyenne Jackson.
“Hello Again” largely eschews dialogue as it leaps among historical eras and song sequences, depicting a series of fraught romantic encounters across decades. (Few film musicals have so teemed with non-graphic scenes of sexual acts.)
It begins with a woman (Ms. Plimpton) who enters a peep-show-like chamber, seeking counsel about love from a mysterious masked man before her. And then it’s off to a coupling between a prostitute and a soldier in 1901; a tryst between a rich man (T. R. Knight) and a younger one on the Titanic; a 1920s affair in a movie theater involving an adulteress (Rumer Willis); a Greenwich Village disco hookup in the 1970s; and so on. The best comes near the end, when Ms. McDonald, as a singer in 2002 reaching for a comeback in a cheesy music video, puts Auto-Tune to shame. A later segment takes place in 1989, in which Ms. Plimpton plays a Washington senator keeping her lover (Ms. McDonald) a secret. Their scenes together are worth the price of admission.
The movie benefits from Austin Schmidt’s neon-infused cinematography and Annie Simeone’s lush production design. But Mr. LaChiusa’s songs largely fail to resonate here. Dramatic traction suffers, probably as a result of the many, and diffuse, vignettes. And yet this is a commendably audacious effort by Mr. Gustafson (“Were the World Mine”). The movie musical needs more ambitious creators like him.",0.722810201,Drama

But he has commendable restraint, and his latest film, “I Remember You,” transcends genre pyrotechnics even as it incorporates elements of Nordic noir.
The film — adapted by Mr. Axelsson and Otto Geir Borg from a novel of the same name (subtitled “A Ghost Story” in one edition) by Yrsa Sigurdardottir — tells of the entwining fates of three victims of acute misfortune.
Freyr (Johannes Haukur Johannesson) is a psychiatrist tormented by the memory of his son, who mysteriously vanished years ago in a game of hide-and-seek. Now Freyr is enlisted by the police to interview the husband of an old woman who has killed herself. Working with a detective (Sara Dogg Asgeirsdottir), he uncovers multiple deaths linked to the suicide, all connected by a crime in the distant past.
Grievous loss also afflicts Katrin (Anna Gunndis Gudmundsdottir) and her husband, Gardar (Thorvaldur David Kristjansson), who — with a friend, Lif (Agusta Eva Erlendsdottir) — have started renovating a decrepit house in Iceland’s remote and stunningly stark Westfjords region. As Katrin wrestles with psychological demons, she senses a more supernatural threat.
And then there is Bernodus (Arnar Pall Hardarson), an abused child from long ago whose life, death and afterlife yield grave consequences.
Mr. Axelsson knows his faded photographs, eye-blink spectral visitations and droning soundtracks, plus that standby: the wall covered with newspaper clippings of serial murder. But he minimizes the gore, piercing the soul with mood and compelling human conflict. Which makes “I Remember You” memorable indeed.",0.679912763,Drama

Some 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks in the early part of the 20th century. What should be an accepted fact remains a provocative topic, as the Turkish government continues to ignore or deny the events and, as it has for a century, coerce businesses and push other governments to do the same.
Joe Berlinger, the director, uses old footage of survivors and insights from historians to provide an overview of the crimes. He also embeds himself with the cast and crew of “The Promise,” a recent fictional film set around 1915 that explores the fighting and mass killings. Mr. Berlinger’s plan is smart as well as symbolic — evidence shows that the Turkish government has often pressured studios into shelving movies about the genocide.
Discussions on the film set are intertwined with historical analysis, and there are explorations of crowd psychology, revisionism and German cooperation with the Ottoman Turks; it’s no stretch to see how the massacre of Armenians helped lay groundwork for the Holocaust.
At its core, “Intent to Destroy” is a call to remember the victims, both for their sake and for our own. “If you want to understand Yugoslavia, if you want to understand Rwanda, if you want to understand any other mass atrocity [that] is happening today, you should really look into the Armenian genocide,” one scholar says near the end of the documentary. “History is not in the past.”",0.776341533,Documentary

And yet, glimmers of promise abound.
Ms. Morgan plays Annette, an unrealized Type A writer living with the milquetoast Elliot (Jorma Taccone), a writer-director on a “Game of Thrones”-like TV show. Their friend Baker (Dree Hemingway), an interior designer who pines for marriage but sleeps with men too quickly, pursues a loveless affair with a married man (Tate Donovan). When Annette and Elliot separate because of Annette’s restlessness, she canoodles with a disheveled dilettante (Robert Schwartzman). As for Baker, her cousin (Kentucker Audley) promises to hook her up with a colleague.
In Annette, Ms. Morgan (who wrote the Kristen Wiig vehicle “Girl Most Likely”) gives herself the smart, loquacious and caustic role, while Ms. Hemingway (“Starlet”) plays the needier, less intellectual of the two. Amid peppery dialogue and solid production values, the movie acknowledges show-business absurdities (green-screen emoting, the seeming ubiquity of people hawking their own scripts) with rueful affection. But the film stoops to using a prostitute (Margarita Levieva) — yes, she proves to have a heart of gold — to validate Elliot’s virility.
As a screenwriter, Ms. Morgan is nimble with glib conversation, and she is fearless at playing an often unlikable character. But this movie might only narrowly pass the Bechdel test, and mustering sympathy for Annette’s affluent, insular circle is difficult. The plot resolutions ultimately feel pat, and the conflicts, in retrospect, thin. You sense that Ms. Morgan can deliver harder punches. Maybe someday she will.",0.321432649,Comedy
24,"Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond - Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton",11/17/2017,11/16/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/movies/review-jim-and-andy-jim-carrey.html,,1,"The laughs in the new documentary about Jim Carrey and Andy Kaufman don’t just pop, they also gush. The giggles start with the playful title: “Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond — Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton.” It’s an amusing pileup that in its excess hints at the rich weirdness that emerged when Mr. Carrey nearly went off the rails playing Kaufman in the biopic “Man on the Moon.” One of those tidy, fumbled stories of genius, it will be forever supplanted by this movie’s dizzily, fantastically entertaining account of its two strange, twinned and messy geniuses.
Kaufman, who died from lung cancer in 1984, was a standup who hit the mainstream playing Latka Gravas, a mechanic of indeterminate national origin, in the sitcom “Taxi.” That show was a critical favorite, if not a ratings behemoth, and it goosed the big-screen careers of some of its players (Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd). Kaufman wasn’t made for movies, but in live shows as well as on “Saturday Night Live” and on talk shows (David Letterman), he continued to test the limits of his singular absurdist comedy by assuming the guise of innocent fools or spectacularly awful louts. Kaufman is still sometimes referred to as a cult comic, a category that skews reductive decades later.
“Jim & Andy” revisits Kaufman’s tragically abridged story, largely through Mr. Carrey’s experiences playing him. By the time Mr. Carrey signed on to make “Man on the Moon” (1999), he was a major movie star, having appeared in both commercial hits (“Dumb and Dumber”) and critical successes (“The Truman Show”). Physically, he may have seemed a bit off to play Kaufman (too lanky, too crowned with hair), but he took on the role with painstaking if seemingly typical actorly mimicry. Mr. Carrey found the character in big and little ways: in Kaufman’s many voices, his fixed stare and in the walks, stances and gestures he used to play characters or when he was just being (or playing) Andy.
“Jim & Andy” suggests that in finding Kaufman, Mr. Carrey also lost himself, at least for a while (though maybe longer). The story of what happened during the making of “Man on the Moon” has been covered before, including in news articles published around the time of its release. In one, a journalist who visited the set during production noted that Mr. Carrey never broke character even after cut was called. In another account, Mr. DeVito, who played George Shapiro, Andy Kaufman’s manager in “Man on the Moon,” said Mr. Carrey dove so deeply into his role as Kaufman that “Jim only came to work two days during the filming.” That sure sounds like the final word on the Carrey-Kaufman cinematic convergence.
Directed by Chris Smith, “Jim & Andy” reveals that those earlier reports — which read as if yet another performer had taken the whole Method acting thing a touch too far — hardly get at the strangeness that materialized (and lingers). “So, Jim, how would you start this movie?,” an offscreen Mr. Smith asks Mr. Carrey at the start. Seated in what looks like an anonymous hotel room and wearing a luxurious beard and a leather jacket, Mr. Carrey grunts softly and glances away. And then, looking directly into the camera, he says: “Well, if I had my choice, it wouldn’t start at all. It would already have been.” Mr. Carrey breaks into a small, ambiguous smile. “And it wouldn’t end, either.”
Is Mr. Carrey smiling at his words or his memories (or at us)? It can be hard to know, an uncertainty that fits the movie’s exploration of reality and its simulations. By contrast, the documentary’s genesis, which is partly spelled out in title cards, is rather clearer and can be traced to some 100 hours of behind-the-scenes video shot during the making of “Man on the Moon.” This material had been stashed in Mr. Carrey’s offices for almost 20 years until the director Spike Jonze (“Her”), a producer on “Jim & Andy,” persuaded Mr. Carrey to do something with it. Mr. Smith, whose earlier titles include “American Movie” and “The Yes Men,” was hired and smartly set his focus on Mr. Carrey.
The result isn’t another ho-hum documentary likeness in which all the elements neatly and often flatteringly stack up. “Jim & Andy” is instead a complexly layered and textured Cubist portrait, one that’s been constructed from fragments of its two title subjects and their work. In one corner of the portrait there’s something from Mr. Carrey’s life (a story about his father, a glimpse of an early routine); in another, something from Kaufman’s personal history (his family, his work, his illness). Sometimes these fragments rest side by side, at other times they overlap. And, every so often, Kaufman’s notorious alter ego Tony Clifton, an obnoxious lounge lizard, muscles in to upend the entire thing.
“Jim & Andy” folds a lot into its 95 minutes. It slides from art to life — thoughtfully poking around in that blurred space between them — and jumps around in time, all while flipping from Kaufman to Mr. Carrey and then to Mr. Carrey as Mr. Kaufman. (The editor is Barry Poltermann.) You never get lost amid all these multiple identities and realities, which Mr. Smith amusingly, at times alarmingly, gathers together. It’s funny watching Milos Forman — who directed “Man on the Moon” — refer to Mr. Carrey as Andy, but when Mr. Carrey turns into Tony Clifton something more sinister and menacing comes through. Is this art, indulgence or madness? As this documentary reminds you, with hard laughter and startlingly intense emotion, comedy always needs its pound of flesh.",0.061268514,Documentary
25,Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold,10/27/2017,10/24/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/movies/joan-didion-the-center-will-not-hold-review-griffin-dunne.html,,1,"Joan Didion’s meticulously calibrated prose has the effect of placing her at a particular remove from the reader. The persona she creates on the page is always frank but never ingratiating.
So it’s disarming to see a relatively cozy Joan Didion in the documentary “Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold,” but it should not be surprising. The movie is directed by Griffin Dunne, one of Ms. Didion’s nephews, who also appears as an onscreen interviewer. The Dunne-Didions are a storied family whose members are, and have been, significant cultural forces. They are also a clan rived by tragedy. Two of Ms. Didion’s most celebrated recent works concern the deaths of her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, and her daughter, Quintana Roo.
The exchanges between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion are at once fond and candid. When Mr. Dunne suggests that his uncle, Ms. Didion’s husband, was a “protector,” Ms. Didion nods animatedly before adding, “And a hothead.”
The relationship between Mr. Dunne and Ms. Didion limits the movie in certain ways, but opens it up in others. Mr. Dunne’s longtime family connections and his own prestige as a filmmaker no doubt helped him snag interviews that other documentarians would be hard-pressed to schedule. Ms. Didion’s friend Calvin Trillin is among the interviewees, and while I’d never dare suggest that great writer is not a big get, I was impressed in a different way when Harrison Ford showed up.
While the movie covers the whole of Ms. Didion’s life (and even the period before it, offering a fun fact that at one point the pioneer Didions traveled with the Donner party), those expecting a thorough examination of Ms. Didion’s work may be disappointed. Which is not to say that Mr. Dunne, a very canny filmmaker, doesn’t accomplish a lot via implication. The movie is subtly bracketed by readings of Ms. Didion’s appreciation of John Wayne, in an early essay, and her excoriation of Vice President Dick Cheney, in a later one. Unlike a great many more facile thinkers, Ms. Didion clearly does not consider them equivalent figures. But the citation of both works illuminates the changes in Ms. Didion’s thinking over the years.
Her early writing reveals the instincts of a conservative. As she witnessed the tectonic shifts in American life wrought by, among other things, the counterculture, she admittedly lost faith in “the social contract,” but did not turn left for solutions; rather, she staked a claim as a kind of ideological outsider. (Two words that are never uttered in this movie are “feminism” and “feminist.”) Mr. Dunne’s movie gets you thinking about all this with extremely well-chosen archival footage and evocative music choices.
The movie’s title, like that of Ms. Didion’s collection “Slouching Towards Bethlehem,” is derived from the W.B. Yeats poem “The Second Coming.” Mr. Dunne’s portrait and tribute to his aunt, now 82, also reminded me of an observation by D.H. Lawrence: “Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically.” Ms. Didion’s triumph, as a writer and a human being, has been to take the age for what it is, to pinpoint how she saw it, and to stick it out.",0.991864908,Documentary

In last year’s magical “Swiss Army Man,” he played a gassy, much-manhandled corpse; now he’s embracing the muck and mortifications of “Jungle,” a real-life survival tale from the Australian horror specialist Greg McLean.
To play the Israeli adventurer Yossi Ghinsberg, Mr. Radcliffe dives into water and quicksand, slathers himself in fire ants, tangles with a snake and excavates a parasite from his forehead. Given that these torments are very much in his director’s wheelhouse, it’s no surprise that they have an energy the rest of the movie (based on Mr. Ghinsberg’s 2005 memoir) lacks.
Yet the look is polished and the setup promising as Yossi heads into the Bolivian jungle with two backpacking pals, an American photographer (Alex Russell) and a Swiss teacher (Joel Jackson). Their guide is Karl (Thomas Kretschmann), a sketchy stranger whose possibly menacing motives cry out for an investigation — fictionalized, if necessary — that never comes. Similarly, Yossi’s friends remain essentially enigmas, generic sidekicks without much to distinguish them beyond degrees of daring and propensity for bickering.
Slow to get moving and dramatically slack, “Jungle” cares only about Yossi, whose solo suffering and speed-enhanced hallucinations dominate the narrative. Despite Mr. Radcliffe’s all-too-obvious dedication (his increasingly emaciated body, astonishingly, was not digitally enhanced), he can’t rescue a screenplay (by Justin Monjo) that cares more about the condition of his flesh than the contents of his head.",0.056559415,Action
27,Justice League,11/17/2017,11/15/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/movies/justice-league-review-wonder-woman-batman-dc-comics.html,PG-13,0,"“Justice League,” the newest DC Comics superhero jam directed by Zack Snyder, is looser, goosier and certainly more watchable than the last one. The bar could scarcely have been lower given that the previous movie, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” was such an interminable slog. The superhero and villain dynamic is much the same (slayers going to slay, etc.), but there are a few fresh faces now and Wonder Woman has more to do than play backup. The story is a confusion of noise, visual clutter and murderous digital gnats, but every so often a glimmer of life flickers through.
The last time he fronted a movie, Superman (Henry Cavill) seemed to die, a plot twist that not even the most credulous viewer could buy. So, of course he’s back in this one, eventually, although first the band needs to get together. Having seen trouble on the horizon, Batman, a.k.a. Bruce Wayne — played with a sepulchral growl and bespoke stubble by Ben Affleck — takes the lead on this enterprise. He’s the insistent manager as well as the scowling host, the guy with the cool digs, smooth rides with blinking screens (“critical damage” reads one with great comic-book sincerity) and suave butler (Jeremy Irons as Alfred). He’s also pretty much of a yawn.
The pumped-up Mr. Affleck again fills out the bat suit from ripped stem to stern, but his costume remains grievously larger than Batman’s (or Bruce’s) personality. Bat-Bruce clearly has some kind of unrequited thing for Wonder Woman, a.k.a. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot, a charming super-presence), which leads him to stammer like a teenager. (She’s got other things on her mind.) He has money and a modest sense of humor, including about his wealth, which inspires one of the movie’s few decent laughs. Mr. Affleck, a generally appealing actor who can plumb the depths when pushed (“Gone Girl”), needs something more substantial (or just more jokes) if his Batman is ever going to work.
As it is, the little bit of bat brooding in “Justice League” feels unmotivated and unearned, and lacks the shading of the character in the “Dark Knight” or even in the Lego movies. That’s too bad, and would be dire if he played a more valuable role. But “Justice League” is about solidarity rather than flying and soaring solo, so the movie spends considerable time piecing together its newest parts: the Flash, a.k.a. Barry Allen (Ezra Miller), a zippy wisenheimer wreathed in lightning; Aquaman, a.k.a. Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa), an underwater tough with a chest full of muscles and tattoos; and Cyborg, a.k.a. Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), a machine man built from metal and serious attitude.
The original Justice League of America (as it was called) first convened in 1960; the movie takes place in the present or at least a facsimile of the same. The world is in mourning for Superman, and so is Lois Lane (Amy Adams, shedding tears and largely wasted). Everything is about to get worse, because of course it has to, leading Bat-Bruce and Wonder-Diana to round up a troika that was teased earlier. Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the introductions to these three newcomers, who step up beauty pageant-style to fill in some back story — one has roots in Atlantis, the other two are from hard-luck city — while flexing individual quirks and superpowers.
“Justice League” settles into a groove once it finds its gang. As Bat-Bruce moodily pushes and prods and Wonder-Diana smiles and smirks, the newbies jockey for position. The Flash gets most of the best jokes, and Mr. Miller makes most of them work, largely in the role of in-house fanboy with a touch of the Cowardly Lion. It’s golly-gee stuff, but it’s also human and Mr. Miller keeps you hooked, as does Mr. Momoa (“Game of Thrones”), who supplely shifts between gravitas and comedy. When Aquaman chugs a bottle of booze before plunging into an angry sea, the movie hits the comic-book sweet spot between deadly seriousness and self-amused levity.
Cyborg isn’t as buoyant a presence, which makes sense for a character who’s been partly cobbled together from scraps and a sob story that Mr. Fisher puts across with bowed head and palpable heaviness. The hoodie he sometimes wears, which can’t help but evoke Trayvon Martin, imparts a larger meaning that the movie doesn’t or can’t explore. Like the references to a coming world catastrophe that suggestively shudders with wider implications, the hoodie suggests filmmakers who are still struggling to keep an eye on the offscreen world while spinning a fictional universe that can somehow offer a brief escape from it.
Mr. Snyder remains regrettably committed to a dark, desaturated palette that borders on the murky, and this movie’s chaotic, unimaginative action scenes can drag on forever. But the touches of humor in “Justice League” lighten the whole thing tonally and are a relief after the dirgelike “Batman v Superman,” which he ran into the ground with a two-and-a-half-hour running time. (“Justice League” clocks in at a not-exactly fleet two hours.) Written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon, the new movie shows a series that’s still finding its footing as well as characters who, though perhaps not yet as ostensibly multidimensional as Marvel’s, may be more enduring (and golden). It has justice, and it has banter. And while it could have used more hanging out, more breeziness, it is a start.",0.364748352,Action
28,L'enfant secret,10/18/2017,10/17/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/movies/lenfant-secret-review-philippe-garrel.html,,0,"The peculiar dark magic of “L’Enfant Secret,” a 1979 film by Philippe Garrel only now seeing theatrical release in the United States, begins with its models. “Models” was the term the monumental French filmmaker Robert Bresson used for the men and women he cast in his films; he believed acting was an art best reserved for the theater, so he recruited faces and bodies he felt could carry his intents, and instructed them to enact precise physical movements, but not to emote.
Mr. Garrel, a filmmaker since his teens, is looser and more expansive in his approach. Nevertheless, in this film he cast two former Bresson “models,” Anne Wiazemsky and Henri de Maublanc, as the lovers Elie and Jean Baptiste. The secret child of the title is, in a sense, the film itself, one in which, according to Mr. Garrel, he “returned to autobiography” after a series of experimental features.
But the movie does feature a little boy named Swann who belongs to Elie. The adorable blond moppet, she tells Jean-Baptiste, is the son of a film actor who refuses to acknowledge paternity, even though his mother is raising the child. It reflects Mr. Garrel’s own long love affair with the musical artist Nico, who had a child she said was the son of the French film star Alain Delon. He never acknowledged the boy, but his parents largely raised the child in his early years.
Ms. Wiazemsky and Mr. de Maublanc maintain a kind of Bressonian passivity in enacting the dank, entropic spiral that sucks their characters ever downward. They alternately try to maintain, or violently break away from, their intimacy. Mr. Garrel’s approach to narrative here is deliberately provisional; he presents a number of story modules which fragmentedly depict Jean-Baptiste’s mental breakdown, Elie’s mourning over the death of her mother and the couple’s flirtations with potential new lovers and dangerous drugs.
Most sad stories of love in our culture express disappointed romanticism. In the world of Mr. Garrel, whose whole work can be seen as an inquiry into the nature of love, romanticism is crushed, slowly and inexorably, yet refuses to die fully. The movie’s few moments of respite from this process are provided through brief shots of the couple walking hand in hand with Swann. Far longer are the shots of them on a park bench in the pouring rain, or sitting on a mattress on an apartment floor, framed by dingy off-white walls.
Mr. Garrel’s work has a unique aesthetic that today’s American cinephiles seem to be hungry for; this movie’s long-overdue release here is part of a longer retrospective at the Metrograph. One reason Mr. Garrel’s earlier work has been hard to see in this country is that his early career was more or less as an underground filmmaker — one of the inspirations he cited during a recent New York appearance is Andy Warhol, whom he met through Nico. “L’Enfant Secret” forms a kind of bridge between his more abstract pictures and the narratives of the ’80s and beyond, extending to his latest movie, “Lover for a Day,” which was seen at the New York Film Festival and will have a theatrical run here next year.
“L’Enfant Secret” is shot in a black and white that is frequently out of focus, by a camera that’s intentionally not entirely steady. Some shots are reiterated in the ultra-grainy form in which they might have been viewed as rushes, or through a Moviola. Part of Mr. Garrel’s mastery is his ability to make expressive use of what would constitute dire technical flaws in other people’s films. The loose ends, the ragged edges, the awkward cuts: Here they’re like the angry low-fi communication of a postpunk song, desperate in its constricted ability to evoke the ineffable.",0.820512862,Drama
29,Lady Bird,11/3/2017,10/31/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/movies/lady-bird-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan.html,R,1,"Christine McPherson, who prefers to be called Lady Bird — it’s her given name, she insists, in the sense that “it’s given to me, by me” — is a senior at a Catholic girls’ high school. Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), the principal, has read Lady Bird’s college application essay. “It’s clear how much you love Sacramento,” Sister Sarah remarks. This comes as a surprise, both to Lady Bird and the viewer, who is by now aware of Lady Bird’s frustration with her hometown.
“I guess I pay attention,” she says, not wanting to be contrary.
“Don’t you think they’re the same thing?” the wise sister asks.
The idea that attention is a form of love (and vice versa) is a beautiful insight, and in many ways it’s the key to “Lady Bird,” Greta Gerwig’s beautiful, insightful new film, the first for which she is solely credited as writer and director. Ms. Gerwig, a Sacramento native and member of her heroine’s generation — the movie takes place mostly during the 2002-3 academic year — knows her characters and their world very well. Her affection envelops them like a secular form of grace: not uncritically, but unconditionally. And if you pay the right kind of attention to “Lady Bird” — absorbing its riffs and digressions as well as its melodies, its choral passages along with its solos and duets — you will almost certainly love it. It’s hard not to.
Lady Bird herself may be a bit more of a challenge. Played with daunting, dauntless precision by Saoirse Ronan (already, at 23, one of the most formidable actors in movies today), Lady Bird can give herself and everyone around her a hard time. Not because she is especially reckless or troubled — “Lady Bird” is the farthest thing from a melodrama of youth gone wild — but because she insists on asserting her own individuality, even when she’s not quite sure what that means.
She tackles the practical and spiritual project of becoming who she is with the mixture of self-assurance and insecurity common to adolescents of a certain sensitive kind. She is idealistic and hypocritical; self-centered and generous; a rebel and a conformist; an enthusiast and a skeptic. A typical American teenager, but also — and therefore — a unique bundle of contradictory and confusing impulses.
“I want you to be the very best version of yourself,” says her judgmental, habitually disappointed mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf).
“But what if this is the best version?” Lady Bird responds. It’s a sharp, sardonic line (one of many) and also an anguished existential question.
Christine (to use the name Marion gave her) wants to satisfy her mother, which is a difficult task because the standards seem impossibly high and subject to change without notice. She also wants to be true to her own desires and convictions, which is difficult for other reasons.
While “Lady Bird” honors the gravity of Christine’s struggle, it hardly neglects the everyday absurdity of her plight. The very first scene begins in tears. Mother and daughter, listening to an audiobook of “The Grapes of Wrath” while driving home from a college tour, cry over the novel’s moving final sentences. Their shared moment of literary catharsis quickly devolves into an argument, which is punctuated by a startling and hilarious jolt of physical comedy (one of many).
In tone and structure, after all, this is a teenage comedy. It finds humor in the eternally renewable cycle of senior year: homecoming and prom; math tests and school plays; the agonizing stages of the “admissions process.” Along the way, Christine undergoes other, extracurricular rites of passage. She falls in love for the first time and has sex for the first time. She trades in her loyal, longtime best friend (Beanie Feldstein) for a richer, more popular girl (Odeya Rush). She fights with her mother and her older brother, Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues), and leans on her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), an affable fellow with troubles of his own.
You might think you’ve seen this all before. You probably have, but never quite like this. What Ms. Gerwig has done — and it’s by no means a small accomplishment — is to infuse one of the most convention-bound, rose-colored genres in American cinema with freshness and surprise. The characters can look like familiar figures: the sad dad and the disapproving mom; the sullen brother and his goth girlfriend (Marielle Scott); the mean girls and the cool teachers; the too-perfect boyfriend (Lucas Hedges) and the dirtbag boyfriend (Timothée Chalamet). None of them are caricatures, though, and while everyone is mocked, nobody is treated with cruelty or contempt, at least by Ms. Gerwig. (Lady Bird is not always so kind.)
The script is exceptionally well-written, full of wordplay and lively argument. Every line sounds like something a person might actually say, which means that the movie is also exceptionally well acted. It is not too quick to soothe the abrasions of class and family. The McPhersons are hardly poor, but the daily toll of holding onto the ragged middle of the middle class is evident in Larry’s melancholy and Marion’s ill humor. They are a loving family, but their steadfast devotion to one another doesn’t always express itself as kindness. They are real people, honestly portrayed.
That might make “Lady Bird” sound drab and dutiful, but it’s the opposite. I wish I could convey to you just how thrilling this movie is. I wish I could quote all of the jokes and recount the best offbeat bits. I’d tell you about the sad priest and the football coach, about the communion wafers and the Sacramento real estate, about the sly, jaunty editing rhythms, the oddly apt music choices and the way Ms. Ronan drops down on the grass in front of her house when she receives an important piece of mail. I’m tempted to catalog the six different ways the ending can make you cry.
I’ll settle for one: the bittersweet feeling of having watched someone grow in front of your eyes, into a different and in some ways improved version of herself. In life, that’s a messy, endless process, which is one reason we need movies. Or to put it another way, even though Lady Bird will never be perfect, “Lady Bird” is.",0.742620673,Comedy
30,Last Flag Flying,11/3/2017,11/2/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/last-flag-flying-review-steve-carell-bryan-cranston-laurence-fishburne-richard-linklater.html,R,0,"Richard Linklater is one of the great listeners in American movies. At his best — most canonically in the “Before” trilogy but also in films like “Slacker,” “Dazed and Confused” and “Waking Life” — he quiets the engine of plot, keeps the camera at a polite, attentive distance and lets people talk. The content of the conversations is important, but so are the more subtle kinds of information that human speech conveys: the unstated emotions and idiosyncrasies of character that flow alongside and underneath the words.
“Last Flag Flying,” Mr. Linklater’s new feature, is a suite for three voices. It’s a lot of other things, too. A war movie, in its way, and also a road picture and a memory play. Set in 2003, at the stage of the Iraq war when we were assured that the mission was being handily accomplished, it brings together three Vietnam veterans for a somber task. Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) are former Marines. Larry Shepherd (Steve Carell) — his nickname was Doc — served in the Navy. Long-buried bad memories shadow their reunion and complicate their camaraderie, and the circumstances of their meeting dredges up the painful and complex legacy of their not-so-long-ago war.
Back then, Doc served time in the brig and received a bad-conduct discharge — he mordantly calls it a “better career decision” — a fact that connects “Last Flag Flying” to an earlier work, Hal Ashby’s “The Last Detail.” That movie, released in 1973 and starring Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid and Otis Young, was based on a novel by Darryl Ponicsan, whose sequel to that book is the basis of Mr. Linklater’s film. (Mr. Linklater and Mr. Ponicsan collaborated on the screenplay.)
“Last Flag Flying” is not a literal continuation of “The Last Detail.” The names of the men and the details of their shared back story have been changed. A petty theft has been replaced by something grimmer and more specifically tied to Vietnam. But the new movie echoes its predecessor in shape and to some degree in mood. The three men make their way up the Eastern Seaboard, mostly by train, toward Portsmouth, N.H., stopping along the way to break up the trip and vary the scenery.
Portsmouth is where Doc did his time, and also where he married and raised the son whose burial is the purpose of the journey. The young man, who had enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school, died in Baghdad in what the military officially described as an ambush. Doc has sought out his old buddies — though the nature of their friendship is one of many ambiguities — to help bring his boy home. He refuses the offer of burial at Arlington National Cemetery, a choice that frustrates an officious colonel (Yul Vazquez) but that must nonetheless be honored. A member of the son’s company (J. Quinton Johnson) accompanies the older men.
“Last Flag Flying” often plays less like a tragedy than a low-key comedy in a tragic frame. Doc, Sal and Mueller are a perhaps too-perfectly mismatched set of contrasting styles and attitudes. Doc, younger than the other two — he was just a kid when they all first got mixed up together — is the quietest, a timid soul trying not to shrivel up with grief. Sal is the wild man, a motor mouth whose high spirits, you feel, could turn into violent rage in the blink of an eye. Mueller is a reformed hell-raiser who shut the door on his past, sobered up and found a measure of peace as a minister and the patriarch of a thriving family.
The three have a lot to talk about, and they also leave a lot unsaid. Mr. Linklater avoids flashbacks and other obvious ways of connecting the film’s present to its implied past. We don’t see any combat, either in Iraq or Vietnam, which gives the verbal accounts of what happened in those places extra weight and mystery. There is some political venting — none of which fits in a tidy ideological box — but mostly a lot of bluster, chops-busting and reminiscing to pass the time.
The time doesn’t always pass easily, though. The film, like the characters, feels like it’s working things out as it goes along. This is sometimes fascinating and sometimes frustrating. The performances don’t always connect. Mr. Cranston, leaning into a New York accent, his hands and face perpetually in motion, has the busy energy of a stage actor. Mr. Fishburne is a master of stillness, and the dissonance between them isn’t just a matter of the differences between Sal and Mueller. I never made the imaginative leap from performance to reality. The actors somehow got in the way of the characters.
But even if “Last Flag Flying” isn’t quite persuasive, it is nonetheless enormously thought-provoking, and its roughness is a sign of how earnestly it grapples with matters that other movies about war prefer not to think about. It is about the much-discussed division between members of the military and the rest of society, and also about the less frequently acknowledged conflicts within and among those who fight. It uses the language of heroism and sacrifice to challenge popular, sentimental notions of what those things mean, and to connect individual ethics with collective morality. None of that is easy, and what may be hardest to bear is the awareness that a country can sometimes look smaller than the people who serve it.",0.999252025,Comedy
31,LBJ,11/3/2017,11/2/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/lbj-review-woody-harrelson-rob-reiner.html,R,0,"From the moment Woody Harrelson swaggers into “LBJ,” you can see the glinting intelligence and hear the thudding heartbeat that he brings to the title character. It couldn’t have been easy. He’s nearly entombed in facial makeup that obscures his own physiognomy — an actor’s landscape — while bringing to life Lyndon B. Johnson, a transitional, still-contentious figure of fascinating contradictions. This was, history tells us, a politician who early in his career spoke against civil rights legislation yet signed the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, a president who declared an “unconditional war” on poverty at home even as he escalated the war in Vietnam.
Only some of that history makes it into this disappointing movie, which tracks Johnson’s road from the Senate to the vice presidency and then the presidency, an ascension that culminates with him assuming the role of the nation’s healer after John F. Kennedy’s death. It’s a near-miraculous, compressed coming into consciousness (the movie runs 98 minutes) that develops through different time frames and neatly dovetailing scenes that suggest history is plotted by that great filmmaker in the sky. One moment it’s 1960 and Johnson is weighing his chances as the next Democratic presidential nominee; the next, he is struggling to find a place in the Kennedy administration and vainly looking for political love in the Oval Office.
Mr. Harrelson makes Johnson an almost predictably entertaining force, and his performance fills the movie with oxygen whether he’s barnstorming through politics, slamming down phones, lobbing obscenities, braying at his staff from a toilet seat or gleefully grabbing his crotch while announcing that his tailor needs to make his pants roomier. He’s fun to watch despite the facial makeup, which is so distractingly exaggerated that when I wasn’t thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire I was flashing on the rubbery presidential masks worn by the bank robbers in “Point Break.” It’s a wonder that Mr. Harrelson can convey any emotion through all that latexy blubber much less keep drawing you closer to him. I recognized the similarly encumbered Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays Lady Bird, only when she started talking.
Directed by Rob Reiner from Joey Hartstone’s script, “LBJ” is a frustratingly underdeveloped vehicle for Mr. Harrelson’s talents as well as an unfortunate missed opportunity. Mr. Harrelson hits his beats with charismatic menace and a reverberant Texas twang, but he’s booming in a vacuum. Part of the problem is the filmmakers never figure out why this particular story needed to be told at this specific moment; it feels at once dutiful and arbitrary. That’s too bad, especially given that it could have continued a story told through Obama-era movies — “Selma,” “Jackie,” “Marshall” — that, both directly and obliquely, speak to the present through the convulsions of the 1960s.
Taken together, these movies create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a profoundly changing nation using black, female and marginal characters who once would have remained behind while the white hero went off to write history. They represent, onscreen and off, the very changes that they narrate. With its armies of pale men and next to no black characters, “LBJ” doesn’t look all that different from most other great-man stories. Yet there are moments — Johnson conspiring with a racist power broker played by an excellent Richard Jenkins — when the filmmakers seem ready to shake up the story by laying white, male power bare in all its ugliness. In scenes like these, the movie inches around complexity even as it continues to clear the way for another make-believe savior.",0.080163203,Biography
32,Marshall,10/13/2017,10/12/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/marshall-review-chadwick-boseman.html,PG-13,0,"Some biopics go for sweeping and exhaustive, trying to cram an entire life into a tidy two hours or so. “Marshall” smartly opts for modest. With economy, a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances, it revisits an early episode from the life of Thurgood Marshall, the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to hold a seat on the Supreme Court. From the 1940s to the early ’60s, he argued 32 cases before the court, winning most. “Sometimes history takes things into its own hands,” Marshall once said, but he also regularly gave history a shove.
“Marshall” isn’t about the famous cases that he argued in front of the court, including the history-making Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which led the court to declare racially segregated public schools unconstitutional. Instead, the movie focuses on a 1941 case involving Eleanor Strubing, a wealthy white woman from Greenwich, Conn., who accused her black chauffeur and butler, Joseph Spell, of raping her and then pushing her off a bridge. After hours of questioning, Spell confessed. The racist reactions to the charges, which invoked the dangerous Jim Crow stereotype of the ravaging black man, caught the notice of N.A.A.C.P., which sent Marshall to the rescue.
Jauntily self-possessed, the movie’s Thurgood (Chadwick Boseman) rides in like a cavalry of one, taking the measure of the town and its escalating tension. He’s soon joined by another lawyer, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), a button-down type who reluctantly joins the defense and reasonably fears the attention it will bring. The pair’s introduction immediately sets the alpha and beta tag-team dynamic: Thurgood casually asks for a hand with his bags, and Sam ends up carrying the load. The scene telegraphs the shifting power dynamics Thurgood represents, but it also announces that the movie will resort to easy, ingratiating comedy to sell the goods.
Seamlessly directed by Reginald Hudlin from a script by the father-and-son team of Michael and Jacob Koskoff, the movie primarily involves Thurgood’s strategy to free Joseph. Part of what made the case important to the N.A.A.C.P., as the scholar Daniel J. Sharfstein has written, was that it took place in the North instead of the South, where the organization was fighting on multiple fronts. In the 1930s, the activist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that the idea that there was no prejudice in the North was a fable. “The difference between North and South in the matter of segregation,” he wrote in 1934, “is largely a difference of degree.”
“Marshall” takes up that refrain both in its restaging of the trial and through the evolution of Thurgood and Sam’s slow-warming relationship. As the case comes into focus, Joseph (Sterling K. Brown) and Eleanor (Kate Hudson) take their opposing seats, the jury troops in, and the nasty judge (James Cromwell) starts snarling. Thurgood rapidly takes the lead while slyly poking and strategically prodding Sam to rise to the occasion. Thurgood and Sam banter, lash out, jostle for position and occasionally deliver some stink eye, especially Sam (at Thurgood). Like his character, Mr. Boseman is the star of this show, while Mr. Gad is the second banana and often comic relief. Both performers are natural showmen who never step on each other’s moment; they’re fun to watch.
It’s all a bit too much fun at times. The chuckles and legal-eagle bromance make the difficult, disturbing story flow easily, but there are moments when you wish that Mr. Hudlin would ease up on the comedy. Sam, in particular, occasionally comes uncomfortably close to a being a caricature, one of those bespectacled, emasculated types who need a kick in the pants, a sock in the jaw, so they can man up. The broadness of the characterizations is of a piece with the movie’s anxious rhythms and relentless forward drive. These may be a function of the clock running out on Joseph, along with a desire to entertain. But there’s little reflective or quiet time with the characters, these men of righteous action who chase clues before swooping into court and history.
“Marshall” also stumbles somewhat with the he-said, she-said wrangling. The filmmakers effortlessly lay out the very real existential dangers threatening Joseph, whose fate rests either with Thurgood or the howling white mob outside. But the overly broad performances, especially in the zippy courtroom scenes, drain the movie of nuance and blunt its realism, and the contrapuntal his-and-her flashbacks add little. Ms. Hudson’s performance, with its brassy and brittle notes, and its counterfeit hauteur, comes perilously close to cartoonish. She doesn’t do much for courtroom suspense, and neither does the irresistible Mr. Brown, a world-class scene-stealer whose quavering voice and pleadingly earnest eyes make the strongest case by far.",0.969941704,Biography

Maya, a renowned poet living in isolation, believes her work has begun to decline. Her only concern now is with finding a worthy heir to manage her estate. Women need not apply — Maya wants to play with power and toy with the young male poets who offer themselves as her potential successors.
The passions that drive “Maya Dardel,” written and directed by Magdalena Zyzak and Zachary Cotler, are more literary than cinematic. Maya circles her legacy-minded suitors, dropping references to Sylvia Plath and discussing the merits of rhyme schemes and suicide. But for all the linguistic gymnastics, the film is hamstrung by its directors’ lack of visual imagination. Maya challenges her boyish applicants poetically, sexually and finally with offers of intimacy, but the editing all too often settles into a submissive back and forth. During Maya’s tête-à-têtes, we get a glimpse of her home, but every room in her mountainside hideaway has the same sickly hues of blue and green. What little light makes it through appears weak and suffocated, and though the claustrophobia abates when she walks through the California brambles, even nature isn’t immune to the enervating pallor of Ms. Zyzak and Mr. Cotler’s compositions.
The red-blooded vivacity of Ms. Olin’s performance, however, pierces through the muck. She chews feeble lines like meat, spitting out the masticated remains.

Yet here he is in “Mayhem,” still happily slaying zombielike antagonists and up to his armpits in gore.
He isn’t the only one seeking comfort in the familiar. Jumping on the rage-virus bandwagon popularized by the “[REC]” franchise, among others, Matias Caruso’s script unfolds in a gleaming, high-rise law firm where Derek (Mr. Yeun) is being unjustly fired for his boss’s error. At the same time, we learn that the building is under quarantine because of an inhibition-erasing infection that turns eyeballs red and regular people into sex- and violence-crazed lunatics.
As Derek and a disgruntled client (a gung-ho Samara Weaving) fall prey to the virus and join forces to wipe out the firm’s slimy C.E.O. — and anyone who tries to stop them — the director, Joe Lynch, concocts an uneven blend of video game setups and corporate satire. Given that speed and splatter are typically paramount in movies like this, the decision to slow the slaughter every so often to navigate workplace politics feels ill-advised — especially when Derek’s nail gun and selection of lethal office supplies are a long way from exhausted.
Coolly photographed by Steve Gainer, “Mayhem” embraces its pulpy title with fighting-and-fornicating glee. Neither innovative nor particularly clever, the movie understands its mission and benefits from Mr. Yeun’s unfailing air of basic decency.

The film opens with distant shots of diverse women walking through Manhattan before it alights on Luciana (Ms. Asensio), who has left her native Spain after a family trauma. Barely eking out a living — babysitting two indulged Manhattan brats, and working part-time in a chicken costume to promote a restaurant — Luciana is desperate to pay her rent in Brooklyn. She increasingly despairs of ever finding a path to financial security and personal fulfillment.
Her Russian friend Olga (a vivid Natasha Romanova), an ardent believer in the promise of American opportunity, suggests an answer. She invites Luciana to attend a fancy “party” in a Chelsea basement, one that will pay Luciana well for her presence. What Luciana enters is a nightmare rabbit hole of objectification and physical peril for the amusement of wealthy New Yorkers. And we discover what is to become of the women who appear in the opening sequence.
Ms. Asensio paints a Manhattan populated by threatening hoodlums, demanding roommates, indifferent doctors and scheming merchants. Greatly aided by her cinematographer, Noah Greenberg (shooting in Super 16 millimeter), and her sound designer, Jeffery Alan Jones, she uses restless tracking shots, hectic cityscapes, ambient noise and sequences of prolonged stillness to conjure unease and dread.

It is also, as the title suggests, about how things don’t change, about the stubborn forces of custom, prejudice and power that lock people in place and impede social progress. Set mainly in the Mississippi Delta in the years just after World War II, when Jim Crow was still enshrined in law and practice, the film, directed by Dee Rees, tests and complicates William Faulkner’s much-quoted claim about the not-even-pastness of the past. It’s a work of historical imagination that lands in the present with disquieting, illuminating force.
The particular corner of the past that Ms. Rees investigates is not entirely unfamiliar. The source of the screenplay for “Mudbound” (which the director wrote with Virgil Williams) is a novel by Hillary Jordan that counts Faulkner and Toni Morrison among its evident literary influences. On film, the racial history of the American South tends to be flattened into reassuring morality tales in which black lives matter less than white consciences. Ms. Jordan’s book occasionally wanders in the direction of this kind of soothing, redemptive storytelling — the white characters are split a bit too neatly into the righteous and the wicked, their black counterparts confined to salt-of-the-earth nobility — but the movie resists this tendency. Its people, members of two families knotted together by fate, hate and economics, are complicated. The wounds are raw.
What you notice first of all, though, is the land those people inhabit, a sometimes dusty, sometimes swampy area of broad fields and dirt roads that seems indifferent to human concerns. The cinematographer, Rachel Morrison, brings the soil, the flora and the weather to life in a way that emphasizes the archaic, elemental power of the story. Its modern implications are supplied by a cast of subtle actors and by Ms. Rees’s knack for psychological nuance, an attentiveness to quiet moments and unstated emotions that animates her earlier films, the independent coming-of-age drama “Pariah” and the HBO biopic “Bessie.”
“Mudbound” provides her a larger canvas and a sprawling, crowded plot. Relying on multiple narrators to tell a tale (as Ms. Jordan does) is a common enough novelistic technique, but movies sometimes sag under the weight of even a single voice-over. The half-dozen voices who reflect on the meaning of the onscreen action might have been distracting or confusing, but instead, remarkably enough, they provide an almost musical structure and a feeling of moral gravity. What happens is a communal tragedy, but one that is experienced differently by everyone involved.
The Jacksons are African-American tenant farmers who have managed, through years of toil, to arrive at a measure of stability and the guarded hope that something better might be possible in the future. The land they work is purchased by Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke), whose agriculture and business skills fall short of his ambitions. He and his wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan), come to rely on Hap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige). Henry’s feckless younger brother, Jamie (Garrett Hedlund), befriends the Jacksons’ oldest son, Ronsel (Jason Mitchell). Both Ronsel and Jamie are combat veterans, and their natural camaraderie breaks the rules of racial separation, particularly infuriating Jamie and Henry’s father, a hateful old cur they call Pappy (Jonathan Banks).
Pappy’s snarling, slur-spewing villainy verges on caricature, but “Mudbound” does not pretend that his is the only, or even the most insidious, face of white supremacy. Nor does the film locate the poison of racism principally in the attitudes and feelings of the dominant race. What Hap and Florence are up against as they try to provide for their children and hold onto their dignity is a system of organized expropriation — a heritage of plunder (to borrow a term from the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates) designed to keep them poor, precarious and dependent. Their labor provides an insurance policy for Henry’s bad luck and incompetence. Their successes will be punished so his failures can be mitigated and his entitlement upheld. What’s theirs is his.
The more sympathetic members of the McAllan clan — Laura, a bookish, musical, cultivated woman dragged into the mud by the blunt force of her husband’s will, and Jamie, a dissolute, poetic soul of the kind Tennessee Williams would have recognized — are in some ways more dangerous to the Jacksons. Ronsel has seen enough of the world and tasted enough freedom to find the strictures of home intolerable. His insistence on behaving like a citizen already puts him at risk: After both world wars, black veterans were frequent targets of white violence. But Jamie, in his blithe disregard for local norms, is protected in a way Ronsel is not, and his refusal to grasp that asymmetry has terrible consequences.
I won’t spell those out. “Mudbound” begins with the digging of a grave and then jumps backward in time to move slowly toward the shadow of at least one death. Along the way, quite a lot happens — a bit too much, perhaps. There are subplots that might have been excised and twists that are a little too contorted. But Ms. Rees also knows that plot is not everything, and she uses Ms. Jordan’s busy narrative as a trellis rather than an engine. What happens is less important, finally, than who it is happening to.
What stays with you are everyday moments — the wordless communication between Hap and Florence, the aimless soldiers’ talk between Jamie and Ronsel, Laura’s lonely patience, Henry’s simmering insecurity — and the graceful performances that bring them to life. The way those instances of ordinary human tenderness and decency stand out is proof of the film’s achievement, which is to lay bare a world in which cruelty is normal and injustice seems as implacable as the weather.",0.928520163,Drama
37,Mully,10/27/2017,10/26/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/movies/mully-review.html,,0,"“Mully” isn’t much in the way of cinema. But its courageous subject makes this documentary’s shortcomings easier to overlook.
Charles Mully was born in Kenya and abandoned by his family at 6; he later stole and begged on the streets. Through the generosity of strangers, hard work and some prayer, he not only found a job but became wealthy by running several companies, including a bus service and oil and gas ventures.
To the surprise of his wife and eight children, Mr. Mully one day decided to give up business and devote his resources to Nairobi’s orphans. He turned his residence into a shelter, moving in dozens of homeless Kenyans (while sending some of his own children away to boarding schools). Later he built an orphanage that has housed and fed thousands; a farm there is dedicated to environmentally friendly agriculture.
Scott Haze, the director, is eager to inspire. Interviews show Mr. Mully to be resolute, and his family kindhearted. Yet the film’s tone sometimes turns repetitive. In one short section, a few orphans tell of their lives before meeting Mr. Mully. Their brutal recollections are essential to hear, but Mr. Haze hurriedly retreats from those and other harsh topics. Just as vexing, redundant voice-overs describe what is being shown; while Mr. Mully speaks of events, scripted scenes re-enact them.
“Mully” nods toward its subject’s religious faith but refrains from preachiness. Mr. Mully’s actions speak for themselves, and his robust personality makes him a pleasure to listen to. If the film doesn’t always dig deeply into this man’s life, we still see the results of his efforts. Those are enough to admire.",0.682122999,Documentary

In my early teens I saw the then-grand movie adaptation, an all-star cast affair directed by Sidney Lumet and featuring Albert Finney as the finicky Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Christie’s novel derives much of its notoriety from the solution to its mystery. It’s very novel; whether it’s ingenious or just ostentatious is still debated by mystery lovers. But even more than 40 years after Mr. Lumet’s film I had presumed that the ending was so well-known that there would be little point in a remake. And yet, as the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins said in a different context, generations have trod, have trod, have trod, and there are plenty of millennials who haven’t read the book.
Mr. Finney’s embodiment of Poirot in the Lumet picture was a marathon of sorts, with the actor testing how many of the beloved character’s irritating yet endearing quirks could be pushed to the limits of coherence. In this latest version, Kenneth Branagh, who also directs (from a script by Michael Green), gives us a Poirot who’s fussy but not too fussy, and rather crisp in his English-language diction. Most radically, this is a Poirot with heart. This interpretation is a dumb idea, but Mr. Branagh, an actor of prodigious skills, can at least pull this one half off. It’s not the only dumb idea in this film, which nevertheless bounces along in a way that’s sometimes almost entertaining.
Mr. Branagh shot the film in the 65-millimeter format, which offers a particular kind of “big movie” resolution. People tend to think that big-gauge celluloid is best for big-vista movies, such as “Lawrence of Arabia,” but Mr. Branagh’s picture is set almost entirely on a train. It is a very opulent train, and the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos gets all its ornate detail. It also gets the detail of the mostly C.G.I. special effects and settings, and here the marriage of digital and analog is awkward. In further pursuit of 65-millimeter shots, Mr. Branagh opens up the story regularly, however. He has the train stall on a cliff-side rail, supported by elaborate scaffolding on which he stages a foot chase. He has Poirot deliver his final summation of the case in a train tunnel.
As in Mr. Lumet’s adaptation, the supporting cast here is full of stars. Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penélope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, and newer faces like Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr., fill out the roster of subjects. Johnny Depp, who is known to make some eccentric choices in crafting his characters, does not (necessarily) disappoint in the role of the murder victim, Edward Ratchett. Imbuing that unsavory character with the dopiest of gangster mannerisms, Mr. Depp may remind you of Matt LeBlanc’s “Friends” character, Joey Tribbiani. It’s as if Joey, that lovable bad actor, is trying to make the most of his first big break in the movies.",0.908902282,Crime

I recall a guy who, on the one hand, had facial hair before anybody else in his class and, on the other, wore a slide rule attached to his belt. I wonder what happened to him.
In “My Friend Dahmer,” written and directed by Marc Meyers and adapted from a graphic novel memoir by Derf Backderf, that one kid is, yes, Jeffrey Dahmer, who shortly after completing his studies at an Ohio high school began his career as a sex offender, serial killer and cannibal. In this account, the teenage Dahmer is a withdrawn fellow who dissolves roadkill in acid in a shed behind his house and indulges in attention-getting classroom antics. For these he is adopted, in a sense, by three other nerds. Their mischief-making alternates with sometimes grisly scenes in which Dahmer contends with emerging obsessions. When a disturbed schoolmate cuts open his palm and drinks the blood, the others disperse, but Dahmer stands staring, transfixed.
This film is sensitively wrought. It’s credible in its evocation of mid-’70s suburbia. The acting is excellent throughout, and Ross Lynch in the role of Dahmer elicits genuine sympathy for an increasingly lost but not yet monstrous soul. But in abandoning the subjective perspective of the graphic novel, “My Friend Dahmer” feels a little lacking in purpose.",0.961615568,Biography

Otherwise, this narrative feature debut from Camille Thoman is mostly a frustrating jumble of surreal puzzle pieces that audiences will likely be uninterested in solving.
Not that a solution even seems possible. Apparently aiming for an open-ended psychological thriller, Ms. Thoman focuses so fiercely on atmosphere that her narrative isn’t just opaque, it’s a confounding collision of signifiers and symbols. At their center is Miranda (Mireille Enos), an unraveling New York City artist whose work involves invading the privacy of strangers.
“You did a bad thing,” her latest victim complains when she builds an exhibit from information purloined from his cellphone. Bad things are something of a habit: When her married lover (Mr. Shepard) sees a violent assault on the street beneath her window, she tells the police — echoing the plot of Curtis Hanson’s 1987 thriller, “The Bedroom Window” — that she was the witness. Stalking a man she recognizes from a police lineup (Goran Visnjic), her behavior grows increasingly paranoid and unhinged. Is she preparing a new art installation, or is someone trying to kill her?
If only we cared. Ms. Enos is a credibly fraying voyeur, all anxious looks and nervous starts, but “Never Here” is too emotionally antiseptic to engage. That leaves all the heavy lifting to Sebastian Wintero’s moody, nocturnal cinematography, perfectly paired with James Lavino’s dissonant original score. As Miranda prowls the indigo city streets, bathed in ominous whispers and sharp jabs of neon, you might momentarily forget that the movie around her is a tiny bit bananas.",0.331832672,Mystery

But that was old news in Mexico, where months earlier a similar showdown had played out.
After almost two years, two gay men were finally issued the marriage license they were legally entitled to in Mexicali, the capital of the northern Mexico state of Baja California. “No Dress Code Required” documents the obstacles that couple, Victor Manuel Aguirre Espinoza and Victor Fernando Urias Amparo, who goes by Fernando, confronted to reach their goal — and the public support that saw to it they would.
As early as 2010, Mexico’s highest court upheld same-sex marriages, yet local compliance varied widely. Citing religious grounds, the Mexicali mayor and Baja California governor made no secret of their opposition. In the film, Victor and Fernando are repeatedly rebuffed; municipal officials challenge their birth certificates, and investigate a claim they are mentally ill. Three wedding dates are scheduled, then postponed. At one, authorities say a bomb threat is closing City Hall.
Publicly, the men remain amused; privately, they grow increasingly politicized. Asked if he knew what he was getting into, Victor says, “I didn’t understand. I had to change my attitude so people would respect me.” As they become a media cause célèbre, though, the bureaucrats eventually relent.
Cristina Herrera Borquez’s film limits its point of view to Victor and Fernando’s, and doesn’t delve into the opposition or examine the backstage maneuverings. When, as a public demonstration grows, the men are suddenly asked into the mayor’s office, no cameras follow. But they get their license, and “No Dress Code Required” chronicles the grudging advance of cultural change.",0.700581472,Documentary

In the film, directed by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (“Jesus Camp,” “Detropia”), the three have left for different reasons. One, a teenager, Ari, left as his thirst for knowledge came into conflict with religious restrictions. “Wikipedia,” he says, “was a gift from God.” He attends a Christian gathering simply out of curiosity. He also says he has been abused in his past.
Another of the three, Luzer, initially seems like the cutup of the bunch, an aspiring actor who lives part-time in Los Angeles and says he had forged his impression of the outside world from furtive movie viewings. We learn later that leaving meant effectively walking away from his family and children.
But the most wrenching journey is that of Etty, in her early 30s, who seeks a divorce from a husband who, a title card says, was removed by the police from their home for alleged abuse. (At the start of the film, we hear audio from a 911 call that Etty placed after he was escorted out.) The movie makes the case that the Hasidic community has effectively exploited legal loopholes and financial muscle to win custody battles. Ms. Grady and Ms. Ewing don’t show Etty’s face until a powerful moment midway through the film.

If only Joseph Kosinski’s action-drama “Only the Brave” — based on the exploits of the real-life Granite Mountain Hotshots, a troop of elite firefighters near Prescott, Ariz. — had a less generic title and fewer formulaic beats. But under its slick, schematic surface, this tale of aspiration and redemption at least offers moments of genuine feeling.
This is a movie about Southwestern working-class men who drink beer, carry heavy tools, train in quasi-military fashion, banter in a weight room, attend a group family picnic and drive pickup trucks to a soundtrack loaded with AC/DC and ZZ Top. The women in their lives raise children (or train horses) when they’re not scolding their men about neglecting family or the risks of their profession. Amid the familiar milieu, however, there are subtle, inventive touches.
The more aspirational narrative concerns Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin, whose craggy face has never better blended with a parched setting). Marsh is determined to whip the Hotshots into an efficient unit, despite challenges from his forthright wife (a vivid Jennifer Connelly, whose impassioned arguments with Mr. Brolin’s character have their own kind of spark). Marsh, a bespectacled Buddhist in recovery from substance abuse, is a fascinating variation on your typical taciturn hero. (As his avuncular mentor, a veteran fire chief, Jeff Bridges embodies a more conventional template.)
The redemption concerns a feckless pothead (Miles Teller) whose pregnant girlfriend has left him because of his indigence and dissolution. He must win her back and prove himself a responsible, loving father. The Hotshots help, though he must contend with a ne’er-do-well (Taylor Kitsch) with his own immaturity issues.
Mr. Kosinski — and the screenwriters, Ken Nolan (“Black Hawk Down”) and Eric Warren Singer — let the characters grow in complexity before they face their greatest trial. Wisely, they do not overly sentimentalize the conclusion. This may not be a story of triumph, but it’s inspiring nevertheless.",0.99540881,Biography
44,Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,10/13/2017,10/12/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/professor-marston-and-the-wonder-woman-review.html,R,1,"Suffering Sappho, Batman, you’re such a square! That’s especially true when you consider the real origin of Wonder Woman, the warrior with the indestructible bracelets and slightly kinky magic lasso who burst into comics in 1941. As it happens, there was more kink to her story than suggested by that golden lasso, which she uses to force her captives to tell the truth and looks like something from a bondage emporium. “On Paradise Island where we play many binding games,” she says in an early comic while roping another woman, “this is considered the safest method of tying a girl’s arms!”
There are some exceedingly delectable questions posed in “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,” and a few frisky binding games on tap too. A sly and thoroughly charming Trojan horse of a movie, “Professor Marston” tells the story of the man who created Wonder Woman and the women who inspired him, both in and out of bed. The movie gleams and has all the smooth surfaces and persuasive detail of a typical period picture — the fedoras, the rides, the Katharine Hepburn trousers. All that luster, which too often in movies suggests polite manners and drowsily safe entertainment, proves to be a seductive, glossy way into something more satisfyingly complicated.
If nothing else, “Professor Marston” is another reminder that once upon a time people had sexual appetites and relationships as complex as those of today (or of 18th-century France), something else the movies don’t always like to admit. Occasionally, grandpa might have even visited a dusty, mysterious shop with sexy specialty items in front and something naughtier in back. Dr. William Moulton Marston (a winning Luke Evans) finds out just how special those items could be when he pops into a store where a man calling himself the G-string King (J.J. Feild) opens up a world of consensual power play and pleasure.
At that point, life has already become interesting for Marston. The writer-director Angela Robinson lays out just how, well, knotty it all is with wit, sympathy and economy. Spanning decades, the story takes flight in 1928 with Marston teaching young lovelies at Radcliffe. “Are you normal?” he asks of a beaming, receptive audience that serves as an amusing stand-in for the viewer. Marston has answers to that and other questions, along with a theory he calls DISC — for dominance, inducement, submission and compliance — which sounds terribly complex and slightly ridiculous. (“D, I, S and C,” the real Marston wrote, “represent nodal points in the integrative emotion series.”)
Ms. Robinson borrows Marston’s theory, using it as a clever if somewhat schematic framing device as she spins her story. There are moments of domination, psychological as well as physical. There are also interludes of inducement, submission and compliance mixed in with a sweet, soft-focus romance that initially involves Marston and his wife, a frustrated academic, Elizabeth Holloway Marston (Rebecca Hall, tart, brisk, essential), and soon includes a third, Olive Byrne (a very good Bella Heathcote). A student, Olive cracks open the Marstons’ marriage, but instead of destroying it helps it grow into a shared, liberating adventure that settles into something cozily domestic.
The story of the world’s most famous female superhero, her creators and inspirers, has been told elsewhere, including in Jill Lepore’s book “The Secret History of Wonder Woman.” Ms. Robinson draws on archival sources for her telling and takes some liberties with the historical record, shuffling events around to dovetail with the polymorphous possibilities she’s most interested in. The movie recurrently returns to the 1940s with Marston being grilled by a comic-book skeptic (Connie Britton) about his creation, scenes that fill in some details but also interrupt the fluid narrative flow. These sequences read as a stand-in for the 1950s anti-comic-book crusade of Dr. Fredric Wertham, who condemned Wonder Woman as a “cruel, ‘phallic’ woman.”
Dr. Wertham saw cruelty in the Wonder Woman world, but Ms. Robinson sees deep, enduring love in its back story as well as freedom, including from rigid gender roles. Her version of the idealistic professor and his two wonder women, and the complex geometry that defined their relationship, may be a touch fuzzier than the actual story. Certainly the real Marston didn’t have Mr. Evans’s sleek matinee-idol looks. But it’s a pleasurable fantasy, as well as a gentle, appealingly Utopian vision of a world in which men and women can slip from their traditional binds into new, excitingly freeing configurations. Those might be surprising, perhaps even a bit tight around the wrists but, as Ms. Robinson suggests, there are so many possibilities when you’re given room to play.
The real Marston was delightfully unbound. In 1937, Ms. Lepore writes in her book, he held a news conference to announce the coming Amazonian rule. The Washington Post ran with the story: “Neglected Amazons to Rule Men in 1,000 Yrs., Says Psychologist.” The Los Angeles Times went with the punchier “Feminine Rule Declared Fact.” “The next 100 years will see the beginning of an American matriarchy,” Mr. Marston said (2037 here we come!). And “in 1,000 years women will definitely rule this country.” Believing women superior, he thought they had twice “the ability for love” as men, which would allow them to conquer the world. It’s a delicious idea although clearly we could use many more lassos.",0.99833079,Drama

Mr. Heaney was recognized as a master of sean nos (old style) music, a traditional Gaelic variety of a cappella.
He was also an enigmatic figure, according to the film’s director Pat Collins, and “Song of Granite” seems to mirror what the character says about singing. As long as it does right by the music — of which there is plenty — everything else can be a fog.
Shot in black-and-white, the movie tries to shake off the biopic doldrums, employing a fragmented structure that emphasizes isolated moments instead of a narrative arc. It also includes snippets of the actual Mr. Heaney talking or in performance. But Mr. Collins doesn’t shed light on what makes his subject tick, and the arty shards never cohere.
Mr. Collins has cast real singers. Mr. Heaney is played as a boy by the poised Colm Seoighe, then as a haunted, noirish figure by Mr. O Chonfhaola. The character actor Macdara O Fatharta plays him as an older man. The first movement, observing the young Mr. Heaney as he absorbs Irish folk culture in County Galway, is the best and most accessible, before Mr. Heaney goes into moody exile in Britain and New York.
Offering scant commentary on the music, “Song of Granite” will appeal more to enthusiasts than to newcomers.",0.949969392,Biography

This may not be news, even in the movie industry, which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact. Still, every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution. The latest complainant is George Clooney, who in directing “Suburbicon” has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice, of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob.
The title refers to the ticky-tacky Potemkin suburb where it all goes down. You know the place: It’s as American as apple pie and quiet desperation. It’s the post-World War II wasteland with the identical homes, lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature, novels and movies, ever since suburbs were invented. In “Little Boxes,” a 1960s lament about conformity, Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland, where all the “boys go into business and marry and raise a family.” That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge, one that “Suburbicon” delivers anew with cruel laughter, violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling.
Matt Damon plays Gardner Lodge, some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife, Rose (Julianne Moore), and son, Nicky (a good, appealing Noah Jupe), at home. It all looks neat and tidy, especially Suburbicon, a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardner’s sack suits and yards that look as if they’d been landscaped using a compass and protractor. There are a few midcentury modern flourishes, but the sheer, overriding, bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like “Father Knows Best” rather than a riposte like “Mad Men.”
The story opens just as the Mayerses, Suburbicon’s first black family, move into the area, an event the neighborhood treats as a collective home invasion. Women whisper and stare, men sputter and rage, and soon all their white faces have gone red. Before long, unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the family’s home, edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage. And then the fences go up, and the clusters develop into a pack. The whispers morph into jeers, and the progressively, dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin. Any resemblance to the audience watching “Suburbicon” is as intentional as it is obvious.
Mr. Clooney, who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov — reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen — has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle. Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon, and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families, twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images. That there aren’t any movie stars in the Mayers family, though, is an early sign that all isn’t quite as balanced as it seems. Karimah Westbrook has a few good moments as Mrs. Mayers, but Leith Burke, as Mr. Mayers, barely says a word. Tony Espinosa has more to do as the couple’s son, Andy.
Still, the families are further aligned when, shortly after the Mayerses move in, two thugs invade the Lodge home. Except instead of simply robbing the family, they kill someone, violence that shifts the story’s focus to the Lodges. It’s a lurching turn as well as a missed opportunity. The story of the Mayers family is grounded in the history that clearly appeals to Mr. Clooney — it’s based on events that took place in Levittown, Pa., in 1957 — but what happens to the Lodges plays like one of the Coens’ signature Looney Tunes as written by James M. Cain. By the time Oscar Isaac swoops in with a fedora and a wolfish grin, the movie has become a bludgeoning pastiche.
Mr. Clooney gets some things right in “Suburbicon,” including visually and with his two appealing child actors, who together give the movie a heartbeat. As the story grows grimmer and pulpier, he plays with different registers of realism, deepens the shadows and narrows his focus, using tight close-ups and all the wood paneling to box the characters in. But he skimps on the adult characters’ inner lives, and, once the narrative weight shifts to the Lodges, he never finds the tone that balances the movie’s sincerity with its nihilism. One problem is that Mr. Clooney seems to believe in happy endings, however hard-earned, while the Coens — whose presence hovers throughout — are the kind of pessimists who laugh in the dark. The tones and worldviews don’t jibe.
The greater, graver flaw, though, the one that empties “Suburbicon” out and turns it into a mannerist exercise, is that the movie reproduces the inequality it’s ostensibly outraged by. This has less to do with star power and everything to do with emphasis and interest. It’s clear even from her few scenes, including a showdown with a racist, that Ms. Westbrook could have made Mrs. Mayers a force if given the chance. Yet despite the parallel editing, despite the scenes of the mob plaguing the Mayerses — and the images of a black mother, father and son who are sometimes seen but say so little — their terror isn’t about them. It’s about how bad it makes white people look.",0.318876747,Crime

Yet despite laws dictating that her indigenous performances remain private, Te Ata eventually acted and danced on Broadway and for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s White House. She became an advocate, through her own artistic excellence, for the inherent dignity that the federal government denied American Indians — fittingly, her stage name means “bearer of the morning.” Te Ata’s life story is now the subject of Nathan Frankowski’s film “Te Ata,” which goes for the sweep of an epic despite a tight budget.
As depicted, Te Ata, who died in 1995 at the age of 99, grew up as Mary Frances Thompson in the Indian Territory that later became Oklahoma. She devoted her life to relaying the Chickasaw legends she had learned in childhood, in addition to the stories that were shared with her by the diverse American Indian audiences she met on tour.
Produced by Chickasaw Nation Productions, “Te Ata” valorizes this little-known hero, introducing elements of myth like a wandering white wolf to mark Te Ata’s life as its own Chickasaw legend. The film sprawls from the Oklahoma plains to old New York, murkily conveying the passage of time and her rising social status. But the movie’s driving force is its mythic performance scenes, which are choreographed, sung and acted with clear, balletic conviction by the film’s star, Q’orianka Kilcher, who collaborated with Chickasaw researchers and advisers.

It’s “Of Men and War,” a 2015 documentary shot at the Pathway Home in Yountville, Calif., a center designed to reacclimate veterans to civilian life — and also where one of the characters in “Thank You for Your Service” winds up. “Of Men and War” demanded that viewers witness the psychic scars of fighting, measuring them as part of war’s cost along with the dead and more visibly wounded.
Mr. Hall, working in a more sentimental, multiplex-friendly mode, makes the same point here. The movie is partly adapted from the well-received 2013 book by The Washington Post’s David Finkel, who followed survivors of a battalion he had chronicled in an earlier book. Working freehandedly, Mr. Hall contrives motivations and friendships for dramatic effect. (One of the main three returning soldiers in the movie, played by Joe Cole, who arrives in Kansas only to learn that his fiancée has left him, has been added to the mix.)
The central protagonist is Adam Schumann (Miles Teller, convincingly tough), who still instinctively scans American roadsides for bombs just as he did in Iraq. He has missed crucial time with his wife (Haley Bennett, whose character and performance go beyond sympathetic-wife clichés) and young children. He is haunted by two incidents for which he feels responsible: his imperfect rescue of a comrade shot in the head, seen in a prologue, and another death, revealed only gradually, that left his wife’s friend Amanda Doster (Amy Schumer, in a successfully counterintuitive bit of casting) a widow.
The other principal character is Tausolo Aeiti (Beulah Koale, a newcomer), who suffers from crippling memory loss that hampers daily functioning. As with Adam, part of Tausolo’s trouble is admitting his problems to himself. The movie argues that the military stifles such breakthroughs on two fronts: first with a culture that encourages stoicism, second with a failure to provide prompt medical care for veterans.
Striving for the elusive goal of political neutrality, Mr. Hall has made a less jingoistic film than “American Sniper” (in the combat sequences, villainous Iraqis have been replaced with faceless ones). Instead, “Thank You for Your Service” is a macho weepie, whose message — that wars are permanent for those who fight in them — has broad appeal.
That Iraq seems unlikely to produce another “The Best Years of Our Lives” has as much to do with changes in Hollywood craft as with the divisiveness of the war. If, like its characters, “Thank You for Your Service” sometimes struggles to balance staying strong with wearing its heart on its sleeve, it makes an emotional plea in a direct, effective way.",0.944277086,Biography

But I think “The Breadwinner” is worth celebrating, in part because it is a work that in some ways qualifies as reportage.
Deborah Ellis, the Canadian author on whose children’s novel this movie is based, traveled in the late ’90s to Pakistan, where she interviewed Afghan refugees fleeing war and Taliban rule. The hero of her book and its sequels is Parvana, a young girl we first see in this movie with her father, an out-of-work teacher. They are selling some prized possessions in a market square when Parvana’s father is arrested without charges.
Forbidden by roaming Taliban from so much as walking outside by herself, Parvana disguises herself as a boy to provide for her mother, older sister and baby brother. As she deals with ever-mounting difficulties, she expands on a story she and her father had started to concoct before his arrest. Depicted in cutout animation style, it tells of a young prince out to confront an elephant king.
Harsh disappointments befall the characters, and they are depicted frankly, but in a way that encourages young viewers to form an affinity with the characters rather than cringe at terror. The director, Nora Twomey, has a nuanced way with characterization and action, and the voice cast, led by Saara Chaudry of “Degrassi: The Next Generation,” is terrific. In its alternating of Parvana’s day-to-day struggle with the tale she tells herself, the movie doesn’t promote bromides about stories and storytelling transcending reality. Rather, it demonstrates that the way imagination refracts reality can provide not only solace but also real-world strategy.",0.994264142,Animation
50,The Departure,10/13/2017,10/12/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/movies/the-departure-review.html,,0,"Sad, tender and quietly moving, “The Departure” never says more than it needs to, much like its subject, a Buddhist priest who counsels those contemplating suicide.
The documentary, directed by Lana Wilson, follows Ittetsu Nemoto, who after a troubled adolescence became a monk, then a priest, in Japan. He settled with his wife, child and mother at a temple in Gifu prefecture where he spends nearly all his time trying to dissuade those in danger of taking their own lives.
The men and women here convey deep torment and helplessness. Mr. Nemoto occasionally asks questions, gives advice or offers reasons to live. But more often he listens, and his face registers both empathy for them and sometimes despair at his own shortcomings. “I’m sorry,” he says softly to one troubled woman as he looks away. “I’m not being much help, am I?”
His nearness to their pain takes a toll. Mr. Nemoto’s health declines as the unceasing calls and emails he receives wear on him. “I take on so much of their suffering when I’m counseling,” he says. “I can never show them how draining is it.”
Ms. Wilson resists any urge to overexplain the priest’s work or the people he encounters. Instead, she captures their forlorn expressions and records their searching questions. (Viewers seeking additional background on Mr. Nemoto can find it in an excellent article from The New Yorker by Larissa MacFarquhar, which inspired this film.) Nathan Michel’s score is haunting.
Like a haiku, “The Departure” weighs its words carefully. But silences, too, play a vital role here. During its quiet moments, we can only watch this priest comfort the despaired and hope that he succeeds.",0.919716631,Documentary
51,The Divine Order,10/27/2017,10/26/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/movies/the-divine-order-review.html,,0,"If it’s startling that the 19th Amendment, which enshrined women’s voting rights across the United States, is less than 100 years old, “The Divine Order” is set in Switzerland, where the equivalent constitutional amendment — establishing the right for women to vote at the federal level — didn’t pass until 1971.
“The Divine Order” examines that fight for women’s suffrage in a microcosm. Directed by Petra Volpe, the film is set in a conservative Swiss town that has gone largely insulated from the spirit of the swinging ’60s. (To judge from the film’s grayish look, the locality has even escaped the decade’s tie-dyed palette.)
The movie centers on Nora (Marie Leuenberger), who, like most of the town’s women, has been cowed into keeping her opinions to herself. “The more we push, the more the men do what they want,” she tells a pamphleteer encouraging approval of the referendum. Nora’s days consist of caring for her children, indulging her proudly retrograde father-in-law and yearning to take a job that would break the monotony. If Nora’s name weren’t enough of a nod to Ibsen, her husband, Hans (Max Simonischek), addresses her as “my little bird.”
But soon Nora is moved to act. Nora’s rebellious teenage niece (Ella Rumpf) is sent to reform school and then, after she runs away, to prison. Nora reads up on the inequities of Swiss marriage law. A small act of defiance against the town’s leading female anti-suffrage finger-wagger (Therese Affolter) wins her an ally in a feisty widow (Sibylle Brunner), and soon an Italian restaurant owner (Marta Zoffoli) joins them. Their growing movement culminates in a strike that brings the town to a halt.
Taking a middlebrow, mildly rollicking approach to a serious subject, “The Divine Order” doesn’t exactly break new ground. It goes for easy laughs, like a scene in which the women attend a workshop led by a Swedish guru who teaches them a better appreciation of their anatomy. The composer, Annette Focks, supplies an array of insistent Spielbergian music cues, and the film hinges on a pair of big-speech scenes.
Still, “The Divine Order” effectively illustrates how peer pressure can influence the political process. Collective silence, whether it’s from women unwilling to publicly press for their rights or men afraid to voice agreement with their wives for fear of looking weak around co-workers, proves more of an obstacle than any opponent. That message gives Ms. Volpe’s lark a timely edge.",0.962284562,Drama

In his new movie, “The Foreigner,” which he also helped produce, he loses his joie de vivre soon after the opening credits.
Here he plays a single father named Quon, who, as the movie opens, is seen dropping off his daughter at a boutique in London so she can buy a dress for a dance. Then a terrorist bombing blows the block to smithereens and turns Quon into an aspiring avenger. After facing roadblocks with the local authorities, he trains his sights on Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan), an Irish political operative who, Quon is convinced, knows something about the “authentic I.R.A.” that is claiming responsibility for the bombing.
What’s that, you ask? “Authentic I.R.A.?” Why, yes, apparently. In this film’s convoluted scenario, jam-packed with morally bankrupt people doing ugly things to one another, a Northern Irish faction is making an aggressive comeback. The movie, directed by Martin Campbell, is based on a novel called “The Chinaman,” by Stephen Leather, whose I.R.A.-heavy plot may have made sense when it was written in 1992. This boneheaded update practically defines the term scab picking.
But back to the action: Cryptically, and implacably, demanding names of the perpetrators, Quon pursues Hennessy to his country home and makes like a senior-citizen Rambo in the woods. Mr. Chan is in his early 60s, and he doesn’t deliver the action pizazz here that he used to. Nor, frankly, does he summon enough gravitas to be persuasive in the role of a grief-maddened father. For what it’s worth, Mr. Brosnan, as Quon’s nemesis, sells the angry-all-the-time requirement for his character.",0.332376486,Action

Bonnie drinks and dances, swatting away a few overeager hands. After turning down her friend’s offer to split a cab, she stumbles toward home. Bonnie puts on her headphones, she’s in her own world. And then Bonnie is pulled into an alleyway, where she is brutally raped by a stranger.
The rape is an early turning point in “The Light Of The Moon” and what follows are the aftereffects of this violation. Charismatically played by Stephanie Beatriz of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” Bonnie walks us through the bureaucratic process of victimhood — having a rape kit administered, going to the police station to identify suspects, and meeting with lawyers to discuss the likelihood of arrests. But Bonnie also experiences the emotional consequences of rape. She’s angry at her boyfriend, Matt (Michael Stahl-David) for changing his behavior as he tries to care for her, but Bonnie changes too. She’s moody, she’s secretive, her work suffers, and she can’t have sex without thinking of the attack.
No matter how low Bonnie’s spirits sink, the film’s writer and director, Jessica M. Thompson, holds her star up to the light. With colorful sets and bright cinematography to match its lucid emotional logic, “The Light of the Moon” is a realistic exercise in psychological clarity. For viewers whose experiences mirror Bonnie’s or Matt’s, this therapeutically minded movie might remind them of past anxieties, but as a resource for those looking to understand the process of recovery, it’s hard to imagine a more comprehensive or sympathetic look at the challenge of surviving.",0.981762961,Drama
54,The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),10/13/2017,10/11/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/movies/the-meyerowitz-stories-review-noah-baumbach.html,,1,"The New York accent of Noah Baumbach’s new film, which he wrote and directed, is a particular and familiar one. The resonances begin with its title. “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)” takes a literary angle that indirectly suggests The New Yorker, J. D. Salinger and, to some extent, Woody Allen. Mr. Baumbach sticks with the short-story conceit throughout, but he uses it as both a guiding principle and a means to surprise.
After the quiet opening credits (delivered in a terribly genteel typeface), the first line of the first story appears: “Danny Meyerowitz was trying to park.” The movie cuts to a medium close-up of a mustachioed Adam Sandler at a steering wheel looking back over his shoulder and screaming his head off.
This is good for a laugh (and there are more to come), but once Danny pulls out of the impossible space and tools around downtown Manhattan, a different side of the character appears. His daughter, Eliza (Grace Van Patten), has been peppering their parking adventure with some dietary advice for her father, which he shrugs off with good humor. When “Head to Toe,” a 1987 hit by Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam comes on the car’s stereo, Danny and Eliza exchange warm reminiscences while singing along. While he may be prone to parking rage (as who isn’t, but as it happens, he gets mad about lots of other stuff as well), Danny seems, overall, a great dad and a warm-hearted guy.
But Danny’s father, Harold, immediately establishes himself as a less-than-great patriarch when his son and granddaughter arrive for a visit — Eliza just for a night, as she’s headed off to Bard; Danny for longer, as he’s just separated from his wife. Played with spectacularly virtuosic timing and emotional misdirection by Dustin Hoffman, Harold is a sculptor feeling unappreciated late in life. This is a state he can’t help commenting on repeatedly, talking over everyone around him: Danny, Eliza; his current wife and the world’s worst cook, Maureen (Emma Thompson); his withdrawn daughter, Jean (Elizabeth Marvel); and later, his other son, Matthew (Ben Stiller), a successful business manager in Los Angeles whose own reluctant visit is extended by a series of mishaps.
These characters have a lot to work out, and they do work it out, mostly hilariously. The Meyerowitzes are paragons of a specifically Manhattan-style liberal tolerance: The scene in which Danny and his sister and father react with complete nonchalance to Eliza’s first student film, a self-starring quasi-pornographic fantasia about a superhero named “Pagina-Man,” is likely to be cited in a good number of culture-conservative think pieces this season.
None of the Meyerowitzes are fulfilled, and all of them seethe with resentment. Almost everything that comes out of Harold’s mouth is a passive-aggressive accusation pitched with head-spinning atonal refinement, as when, on an unscheduled visit to the home of one of his ex-wives (Candice Bergen, in a droll cameo), he makes a beeline to a bookshelf and says “I think this is my copy of ‘Buddenbrooks.’”
With this film, Mr. Baumbach has achieved a near-perfect balance between engagement and discomfort. In “The Squid and the Whale” and “Margot at the Wedding,” something drove him to depict family squabbles with a candor that approached cruelty. The anger in those movies and some of his others was bracing, though a little more so than necessary. As boisterous and edgy as “The Meyerowitz Stories” gets, it is a more mellow film, and to my eyes and ears all the better for it.
As is customary in Mr. Baumbach’s pictures, the acting is spectacular. Ms. Thompson is hilarious, Ms. Marvel applies her customary note-perfect execution of character, and Ms. Van Patten is what they call a find. And while Mr. Stiller’s Matthew is both reliably and appealingly neurotic, it is Mr. Sandler who excels, both riotously and poignantly.
Mr. Baumbach’s fondness for his characters is such that as the movie passes its 90-minute mark, it becomes evident that he doesn’t want it to end. This compels him to end it several more times than he needs to. My fondness for the characters had become such that I really did not mind.",0.946890774,Comedy
55,The Snowman,10/20/2017,10/19/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/the-snowman-review-michael-fassbender-jo-nesbo.html,R,0,"There are a couple of mysteries swirling through “The Snowman,” a leaden, clotted, exasperating mess. This ostensible whodunit involves a serial killer who’s preying on women, leaving behind carefully arranged body parts and a childlike snowman as a kind of elaborate signature. The greater puzzle, though, is how an enterprise studded with so much talent — starting with the director Tomas Alfredson (“Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy”) and including the star Michael Fassbender — has led to such a grim, thrill-free thriller, one without a twitch of real feeling and next to no elementary story sense.
Mr. Fassbender plays Harry Hole, a dissipated, alcoholic detective living in Oslo, which presumably means he’s Norwegian even if he (and most everyone else) speaks in English. With his red-rimmed eyes and a cigarette drooping from his lips, Harry comes across as one of those classically shabby gumshoe types, the existential inside-outsider who chafes against the rules even as he saves the day. He has an ex (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and a new colleague (Rebecca Ferguson), and soon he has a mess of trouble that he navigates amid a great deal of snow, byzantine developments, dead-end detours and a grab bag of random characters. (Val Kilmer, Chloë Sevigny and Toby Jones all breeze by.)
The problem isn’t the narrative complications, even if the movie soon becomes mired in them. Raymond Chandler tied his novel “The Big Sleep” into so many knots that apparently he couldn’t tell who killed one of its characters. As Leigh Brackett, who helped turn the novel into the 1946 film, said, “When you read it from page to page it moves so beautifully that you don’t care.” The problem, Brackett said, was “if you start tearing it apart to see what makes it tick, it comes unglued.” The trick was to hold on to Chandler’s language and go with his flow, mood and milieu, letting — as the film’s director, Howard Hawks, said later — the characters “handle the plot, rather than let the plot move them.”
Certainly “The Snowman” might have been better if someone at some point had learned from Hawks (always a good idea) and let the characters handle the plot. That might have helped, at least a little. The movie is based on a novel by the popular Norwegian writer Jo Nesbo, whose intricately involved, atmospheric tales are far more complex — they have politics, themes and worldviews — than anything in this movie. Shot to shot, Mr. Alfredson and his estimable team give you plenty to look at, including acres of blinding white snow, noirish nights, desaturated pooling red, a sleekly generic Euro-scape and Mr. Fassbender’s expressionless mug. Yet there’s no glue — not a whiff of life or a single substantial, grounding directorial idea — that makes this pottage work scene to scene.",0.721930494,Crime
56,Thor: Ragnarok,11/3/2017,11/1/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/movies/thor-ragnarok-review-chris-hemsworth.html,PG-13,0,"There’s a nice bit in “Thor: Ragnarok,” the latest Marvel blowout to feature the god of thunder, where he tries to start a jet using a voice-activated password. He needs to make a getaway — he’s neck deep in trouble and plot entanglements — so identifies himself as the “strongest Avenger.” No dice. Given his earlier stand-alone movies, Thor might have had better luck cracking the code if he’d copped to being the “most boring Avenger.”
Through no fault of their likable star, Chris Hemsworth, the Thor movies have been largely forgettable, memorable mostly for the upstaging antics of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and as a bad fit for Natalie Portman (Thor’s former love interest, now mercifully banished into the storytelling cornfield). “Ragnarok” tries hard to change that profile, and mostly succeeds by knocking its big, blond beauty consistently down to size. It makes sense for all sorts of reasons, including that superheroes can so easily appear to be on the wrong side of history, especially those who look like Aryan cartoons.
That isn’t Thor’s fault; he was drawn that way. But times change, and a conceptual makeover was necessary — and not just to boost his box-office appeal. Marvel could have gone grimmer, broodier and sterner, but that isn’t its onscreen way; so it has made Thor sunnier, sillier and funnier. It’s a good fit, at least for a while. Like some other superheroes, Thor has been good for the occasional light, mocking laugh, often hooked to his otherworldly identity: He’s a god (as he likes to announce), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and so forth. For much of “Ragnarok,” he’s a playfully sustained joke.
As a storyteller, the director Taika Waititi (“Hunt for the Wilderpeople”) has a charmingly idiosyncratic human touch and a gift for turning goofiness and gab into personality. That gift is first evident here in the intimate huddles between Thor and whoever happens to be within chatting (or shouting) distance. There’s a lot of yakking, some barking; at one point, Odin does some god-splaining. The Chatty Cathies also include Thor’s sister, Hela (a vamping Cate Blanchett), an overgrown Goth Girl with smudged eye makeup and killer dominatrix looks who plays very hard. She lusts for Odin’s realm, which remains as drearily amorphous and anonymous as before.
The story is an uninteresting thicket of brawls, machinations and useful coincidences. (Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay.) Soon after Hela appears, she moves back home and Thor lands elsewhere, allowing her to run amok — kill, strut, repeat — and him to leisurely settle into his new, more lighthearted mode until it’s serious hammer time. Much of his great un-Thoring happens on Sakaar, a planetary garbage dump run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum, comically jiving and dithering), a psychopath Auntie Mame in flowing gold lamé and blue fingernail polish who suggests a low-rent version of Stanley Tucci’s host in “The Hunger Games.”
The Grandmaster presides over a gladiatorial game, an exasperatingly lazy and uninteresting story development that is mostly (mostly) alleviated by Mr. Waititi’s handling of the material. It’s here that the vibe relaxes and the picture’s filigree becomes brighter and wittier as extras with puffball hairdos straight out of Dr. Seuss light up the background. It’s also here that Thor reunites with the Hulk, who’s been crushing the gladiatorial competition on an extended incredible bender. After he and Thor engage in some Steinbeckian George-and-Lennie riffing, the Hulk’s inner mouse, Bruce Banner, takes over, and Mark Ruffalo eases in to help turn the temperature from hot to cozy.
Mr. Hemsworth looks happier and far more relaxed in “Ragnarok” than he did in the previous Thor vehicles, which is perhaps Mr. Waititi’s truest achievement here. For a guy who looks chiseled by Michelangelo, Mr. Hemsworth can be a surprisingly agile physical performer, capable of real bounce, and he clearly likes ricocheting off walls as much as he does ceding center stage to the other actors. These include Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, who, after an unpromising entrance, develops into a real character with emotion and an all-too-brief flashback filled with fury, beauty, liquid motion and mythological mystery.
That scene is a jolt, because it’s a reminder of the narrative ambition and mythic grandeur that’s often reduced in this franchise to epic fights, fancy elocution and special effects. It’s amusing how “Ragnarok” humanizes Thor, yet in doing so it dilutes his Thorness, the essential qualities that make him more than a dude with a cool hammer. And the more familiar and less godlike he becomes, the more evident it is that this series has never figured out how to make his myth fit with the modern world. So it’s made Thor a fish out of water and a recurrent punch line. Now, though, with Thor (and Mr. Hemsworth) at last settled in, what he needs is a myth as mighty as his shtick.",0.718580371,Action
57,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",11/10/2017,11/8/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/movies/review-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-martin-mcdonagh.html,R,0,"At one point in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” Frances McDormand tears the movie open, showing you what a broken heart looks like. It happens during an uneasily intimate encounter between her character, a tough number named Mildred, and an ailing police chief, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). Until then, Mildred has seemed impervious to his pain. She has rented three billboards attacking his failure to solve her daughter’s murder — one reads “Raped While Dying” — and has been so wrapped up in her hurt that she hasn’t seen anyone else’s. When she realizes how sick Willoughby is, she looks at him as if for the first time. She’s staggered, and so are you.
The pain of others haunts “Three Billboards,” at least whenever the writer-director Martin McDonagh lets it. A playwright (“The Pillowman”) turned filmmaker (“In Bruges”) who’s somewhat of a subgenre unto himself, Mr. McDonagh is a pain artist whose tools include absurd violence, cruel laughs and sucker punches. He skated through his last movie, “Seven Psychopaths,” a barely there comedy that pivots on a creatively stalled screenwriter. As this précis suggests, Mr. McDonagh doesn’t have much to say in that movie — it has a bunny, stolen dogs, guys with guns, good and bad jokes — but what little is said is said by very fine performers grooving on all his words and larky nonsense.
“Three Billboards” is more ambitious than Mr. McDonagh’s earlier features. Like the older ones, it has loads of gab, plenty of guns and the spectacle of men (mainly) behaving terribly. It also restlessly, if not satisfyingly, shifts between comedy and tragedy — a McDonagh specialty — splattering blood along the way. This time, though, he has also given his movie characters instead of disposable contrivances, a plot instead of self-reflexive ideas about storytelling and a rather diffuse overarching metaphor. Mostly, he has freighted it with a tragedy that allows the performers — primarily Ms. McDormand but also the equally excellent Mr. Harrelson and Sam Rockwell — to play to their range.
The movie opens on low boil with Mildred behind the wheel of her station wagon near three derelict billboards. It’s an inviting landscape smudged with soft color, but as she stares at the signs with furrowed intensity, she chews on a fingernail so ferociously she seems on the verge of tearing it off. The billboards aren’t blank — the faded image of a baby smiles down from one, the word “life” pops off another — but they’re the opening pages in Mildred’s opus. Stamping black text against a blood-red background, she uses the billboards to announce her crusade while Mr. McDonagh (who likes self-aware gestures) lays out the story’s fundamentals: its setting, characters, problem, plot and possible villain.
The billboards are a gimmick for Mr. McDonagh and a gambit for Mildred, a way to get things jumping (the investigators, the tale) and splash some foreboding on an outwardly pacific scene. Much of the story involves the ripples of outrage, confusion and buffoonery that the billboards inspire and that soon envelop almost everyone Mildred knows. Months after her daughter’s death, grief has walled her in; isolating and seemingly impenetrable, it is inscribed in the hardness of her gaze and in her grim new identity as a mother of a dead girl. The billboards turn that grief into a weapon, a means of taking on the law and assorted men — a threatening stranger, a vigilante dentist and an abusive ex (John Hawkes) — who collectively suggest another wall that has closed Mildred in.
Mr. McDonagh likes to play comedy against violence and to wring laughs out of the unspeakable. This kind of juxtaposition (in his movies, at any rate) can produce laughter that catches in your throat, giving you pause and maybe provoking thought about why exactly you are giggling. But he doesn’t always know his A material from his B, or doesn’t care; his jokes can be uninterestingly glib with tiny, bloodless pricks that are less about challenging the audience than about obscuring the material’s clichés and overriding theatricality. Everything fits together too neatly in “Three Billboards,” even when chaos descends, but the performers add enough rough texture so that it doesn’t always feel so worked.
Ms. McDormand roughs it up beautifully. A performer of great unforced naturalism, she has always come across more like a character actor than a star, even when she has the lead. She never seems concerned about losing the audience’s love or its sympathy, which can be thrilling, particularly given that female performers are often asked to pander or seduce. In this movie, she makes pain so palpably all-encompassing that you see it in her character’s every glance and gesture: It squares Mildred’s jaw, hardens her mouth and turns her face to stone, as if she were further fortifying her defenses. But pain also makes her ugly, maybe irredeemable, which also makes her joltingly, excitingly human.
That same stone face is good for comedy, too, even if Mr. McDonagh’s bids at humor grow progressively less successful. He plays with tones, realisms and ideas in “Three Billboards,” including the sentimentally redeemed white racist, a character that suggests — despite the rage and invective — that Mr. McDonagh holds out hope for humanity after all. The problem is that the idea he hits most insistently is that vengeance is the hurt that never subsides; it’s the hurt that Mildred nurtures and that hardens her and that, over time, becomes so brutally consuming its violence is all but indistinguishable from its cause. Ms. McDormand still breaks your heart, but Mr. McDonagh just wears you out.",0.710928004,Comedy

Nevertheless, their home is an unholy mess, in several senses of the term. Avraham and Shraga inherited the building from their parents. Despite the fact that they look to be of a pretty advanced age themselves, the fellows still seem in need of a parent of sorts.
When a company called Home Clean Home comes in and takes action, the head of the crew begins to work not just as a sanitation manager but as a therapist to the brothers. “I’m sad to see you like this,” the Home Clean Home man (he’s never named) says to one twin after a particularly brutal sweep has been executed in one section of the house.
“It has to be done,” sighs the shamed resident, taking solace in a glass of wine. “I’m addicted to the alcohol,” he explains.
The movie, directed by Antonio Tibaldi and Alex Lora, is quiet and quietly moving and quite different from “Hoarders” in its steady pace and poetic vérité style. It’s a story of unlikely friendship — not to mention a potentially very good promotional tool for Home Clean Home, which does a thorough and, more to the point, exquisitely sensitive job.",0.983361036,Documentary
59,Tragedy Girls,10/20/2017,10/19/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/tragedy-girls-review.html,R,0,"Midway through the horror comedy “Tragedy Girls,” the director Tyler MacIntyre delivers this slasher movie’s first real scare. Two high school social media stars and secretly budding serial killers, Sadie and McKayla, are holding a school assembly for one of their victims, a fellow cheerleader who got fresh about McKayla’s choice of sneakers. As their sanctimonious In Memoriam slide show plays, the dates of the fallen cheer captain’s birth and death flash onscreen, bringing a sickly realization more frightening than any kill: These teenagers were all born in the year 2000.
“Tragedy Girls” updates the slasher genre by identifying personal branding as the horror that trends with the millennial teen. Played with acidic irony by Brianna Hildebrand and Alexandra Shipp, Sadie and McKayla exhibit all the textbook signs of narcissism, and their bloodthirstiness is really a thirst for the followers that murder is able to drum up for their online horror brand. After rehearsing for their own killing spree by tracking and kidnapping the town’s local madman, Sadie and McKayla exhibit a talent for terror to match their social media savvy.
But although “Tragedy Girls” is up-to-date on tweets and technology, its high school dynamics conform to familiar tropes. Sadie and McKayla are catty, prone to jealousy, and quick to swoon before their male victims. “Tragedy Girls” might add group texts to its instruments of death alongside marauding table saws and falling barbells, but the movie’s gender stereotypes keep it chained to the past.",0.961943393,Comedy
60,Tyler Perry's Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,10/20/2017,10/20/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/movies/tyler-perrys-boo-2-a-madea-halloween-review.html,PG-13,0,"About a year ago, Tyler Perry’s “Boo! A Madea Halloween” arrived in theaters. It was hardly distinguished, but it had its moments, largely because of the comic interactions between the outrageous, finely aged characters Madea and Joe (both played by Mr. Perry) and their fellow dyspeptic senior citizens, Hattie (Patrice Lovely) and Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis).
“Tyler Perry’s Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,” which, as usual with Mr. Perry’s pictures, wasn’t screened in advance for critics, frequently feels more like a remake than a sequel. The movie revisits Brian Simmons (Mr. Perry), a single dad, and his rebellious teenage daughter, Tiffany (Diamond White). The respect-your-parents and don’t-even-think-about-having-sex lessons of the previous film have long been forgotten by the characters; if anything, Tiffany, now turning 18, is snottier, and Brian more passive. (The movie introduces an ex-wife, played by Taja V. Simpson, who walks all over him and is too permissive with Tiffany.)
Once again Tiffany is determined to attend a frat party. And, yes, it’s the same inhabited-by-30-year-olds frat from the first film. The twist this time is the fellas aren’t allowed to have a party in the house, so instead they’re having it at Derrick Lake, which was (cue scary music) the scene of a still-apparently-shrouded-in-mystery (with this shoddy script it’s hard to really tell) mass murder back in the 1970s. Rumor has it some kind of massacre-seeking entity haunts the premises.
The prospect of Mr. Perry’s rambunctious Madea possibly taking on a Jason Voorhees-type killer has an amusement value that is not even vaguely realized here. This movie finds Mr. Perry, never the most deft at the technical aspect of filmmaking, drastically off whatever his best game is. Every camera setup is a study in inertia; every other cut is a beat or two behind where a punch line needs to land. To call this movie unwatchable would be inaccurate, though the scenes featuring Mike Tornabene and Yousef Erakat, portraying frat brothers who act as if they are dying to reassemble a group of Dead End Kids for Sidney Kingsley’s play, are pretty painful. On the other hand, the lighting is so weak, “Boo 2!” is quite often close to unseeable.",0.015864434,Comedy
61,Wait for Your Laugh,11/1/2017,11/2/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/movies/wait-for-your-laugh-review-gilbert-gottfried-rose-marie.html,,0,"Rose Marie has been famous for so long that “Wait for Your Laugh,” a charming documentary about her nine decades as a performer, doubles as a history of 20th-century show business, focusing on vaudeville, early radio comedy, the birth of Las Vegas and the evolution of the female sitcom star.
Now 94, Rose Marie, who proudly asserts that she went by her first name before any other celebrity, started singing for crowds at the age of 3, pairing an adorable child’s face with the brassy belt of a grizzled diva. That distinctive voice would later become a terrific vehicle for punch lines. After gaining fame onstage, where she sang a duet with Evelyn Nesbit (the chorus girl whose husband killed the architect Stanford White, setting off a media circus), she moved to radio, film and most notably television. There she co-starred as a wisecracking comedy writer on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” and later for many years on “Hollywood Squares.” In between the successes of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett, Rose Marie, this movie argues, was one of the most important female comic voices in America.
Carl Reiner and Mr. Van Dyke provide colorful personal testimony about working with her — and Dan Harmon, the creator of “Community,” displays an insightful critic’s eye — but the heart of this movie is Rose Marie talking you through her own life with the same attention to pleasing the audience as she shows onstage. Her steely good cheer is good company as she relates taut, action-packed stories about run-ins with Al Capone and Jimmy Durante with a minimum of introspection.
Jason Wise’s documentary, which relies on re-enactments and backstage footage with sparing use of performances, is a love letter to the performer but not the business, in which she managed to achieve a measure of fame for nine decades, while still being overlooked. Her single-minded focus on work is presented as admirable but also something of a curse. As in the documentary “Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,” this is a movie about a star never at peace unless she’s performing, a contrast with “Gilbert,” another compelling, surprisingly moving documentary about an eccentric with an old-school work ethic.
The stand-up comic Gilbert Gottfried has built a highly respected career telling profane, even shocking jokes in a sandpaper voice. The director Neil Berkeley nicely sketches his career with an emphasis on controversial comedy. (“I have a flight to California,” he said at a roast weeks after Sept. 11. “I can’t get a direct flight. They said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first.”)
What distinguishes this documentary is the incongruity between the raucousness of the humor and the quiet, mundane rituals of his domestic life, whether puttering around his New York apartment or in more joyous scenes with his two children and wife, Dara Gottfried.
As an unlikely love story, this movie excels, presenting a relationship so affectionate and warm that it overwhelms the jokes. When he curses at his wife, she takes it as a sweet nothing. And when she cracks a joke, he’s quick with a booming laugh. “Gilbert” is that rarest of things, a portrait of a happy comic.",0.991446268,Documentary
62,Wet Woman in the Wind,11/17/2017,11/16/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/movies/wet-woman-in-the-wind-review.html,,0,"The characters in this Japanese sex comedy include a successful playwright who’s trying to get his head together in the country and his buddy, a local handyman. Then there’s the proprietor of a coffee shop who can’t seem to keep his mind on his business, and a server at said coffee shop, who may or may not be the proprietor’s mistress — but who definitely has an amorous interest in the playwright.
The setup and characters are a little reminiscent of a film by the Korean anatomist of bad romance Hong Sang-soo. But this isn’t any such thing.
“Wet Woman in the Wind,” directed by Akihiko Shiota, is more concerned with sex than sexual neuroses. The movie is one of several recent postmodern reboots of what has been called “roman porno,” a subgenre of erotic cinema that was very popular in Japan in the 1970s and ’80s. These were cheaply made soft-core pictures that could get away with a lot of aesthetic quirkiness, on account of also featuring images of half-naked women like clockwork. Nikkatsu, the studio that pioneered the form, is now commissioning new films as a kind of cheeky self-homage.
But let’s make no bones about it: This is a film designed to appeal to straight male prurient interest. Yuki Mamiya, who plays Shiori, the title character, has a smoldering quality that fills the bill. Much less winning is the way the movie treats consent, as in the playwright’s rough “seduction” of a very young fan. Genre homage or not, trashy, assault-coddling sexism is a turn off — and worse. Perhaps the “roman porno” reboot project should have rebooted its sexual politics before calling “action!”",0.173610172,Drama
63,Window Horses: The Poetic Persian Epiphany of Rosie Ming,11/10/2017,11/9/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/movies/window-horses-review.html,,1,"When we meet Rosie Ming, the heroine of the animated feature “Window Horses: The Poetic Persian Epiphany of Rosie Ming,” she is living with her overprotective grandparents in Vancouver and suffering from a severe case of wanderlust. Voiced by the actress Sandra Oh, Rosie is of Chinese and Iranian descent, but she is disconnected from her family history — her mother is dead and her father abandoned the family long ago. Instead, Rosie writes poems in an ode to Paris, her dream city. But when she is invited to present her work at a poetry festival in Shiraz, Iran, she meets poets who expand her ideas about the art form and about herself.
Rosie listens as diverse artists share personal experiences and national histories through their poetry. The writing in “Window Horses” is unaffected and lovely, with each poem animated in a different style to reflect the variety of life on display. One man was exiled from China after the protests in Tiananmen Square. Another recites Persian poets from the 13th century. None of these artists romanticize France.
Though many of the characters in “Window Horses” share a lively Cubist design, Rosie is the most sparingly-drawn figure onscreen. She is depicted as a stick figure with two small slants for eyes, a rendering that reads as a reclamation of Asian stereotypes by the director Ann Marie Fleming, who is also of Chinese descent. At first, Rosie’s simplicity is jarring. But as the character learns more about her personal and poetic origins, her minimalist frame absorbs the weight of a rich, complex history. That transformation is the great pleasure of watching this small film.",0.218009621,Animation
64,Wonder,11/17/2017,11/16/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/movies/wonder-review-jacob-tremblay-julia-roberts-owen-wilson.html,PG,1,"“I know I’m not an ordinary 10-year-old kid,” says Auggie (Jacob Tremblay), the lead character of “Wonder,” as we see him standing on his bed wearing an astronaut’s helmet. When the helmet is removed, we know how he knows what he knows: His young face is scarred, his earlobes are little flaps and his eyes are seemingly tear-shaped, giving him a perpetual sad-puppy expression.
The good-natured fellow describes his facial birth defects, and the 27 operations he’s endured to deal with them, as “hilarious.” But Auggie is less amused by the prospect of entering the fifth grade, and no longer being home-schooled by his brilliant and loving mother, Isabel Pullman (Julia Roberts).
The Pullmans are an upper-middle-class family living in a fairy-tale New York, one that the film’s location manager conjured up from the most genteel corners of Brooklyn and Manhattan (as well as New Westminster, British Columbia, where the interior of the family’s brownstone was built on a warehouse stage). So Auggie, whose father, Nate (Owen Wilson), has a job that lets him wear a suit and sneakers, is certainly going to a good school. Nonetheless, he knows that he will encounter bullies, and he does. But Auggie is smart, clever and exceptionally good-hearted (at least when he is not being made to feel self-conscious and alone), and has a knack for winning people over.
The movie, based on the popular children’s novel by R.J. Palacio, hews to the book’s multicharacter narration structure. This tactic reminded me of a line in Jean Renoir’s classic “The Rules of the Game” about everybody having their own reasons for their behavior. In Renoir’s movie, that fact is called a “truly terrible thing.” In the world of this film, understanding another person’s reasons is the first step in establishing meaningful communication. During the section of the film narrated by Auggie’s older sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), you learn why, in an awkward first conversation with her future boyfriend, she impulsively tells him that she’s an only child, despite the fact that she loves and ardently protects her little brother.
Directed by Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the screenplay with Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne, the movie has a cast that’s wonderful from top to bottom. As Auggie’s parents, Ms. Roberts and Mr. Wilson are doing things we love to see those actors doing. (Ms. Roberts lets loose with her trademark ebullient laugh at least once, and Mr. Wilson explains life’s issues to Auggie in a droll drawl.) All the young people in the ensemble, anchored by Mr. Tremblay’s Auggie, are perfect.
“Wonder” is that rare thing, a family picture that moves and amuses while never overtly pandering. Mr. Chbosky’s 2012 feature, “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” split the difference between the sentimental heart-tugging associated with more standard Hollywood fare, and the intelligence and intimacy often associated with independent films. He accomplishes something very similar, and equally worthwhile, here.",0.98870248,Drama
65,Wonderstruck,10/20/2017,10/19/2017,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/wonderstruck-review-todd-haynes.html,PG,1,"Stars glitter and worlds collide in Todd Haynes’s “Wonderstruck,” a lovely ode to imagination and to the stories that make us who we are. A cleverly bifurcated tale of two children, it starts in 1977 with Ben (Oakes Fegley), a boy of about 10 in rural Minnesota. He’s in mourning for his mother (Michelle Williams in flashback) and has a question mark — an absent father — that needs solving. First, though, there’s David Bowie on the turntable (“ground control to Major Tom”) and a lightning strike that leaves Ben deaf. Fearless and resourceful, Ben splits for New York to find his father.
Ben’s story-twin, whose life and adventures curiously mirror his own, is Rose (Millicent Simmonds, a discovery), a 12-year-old deaf girl in 1927 who yearns to escape her lonely, cosseted life in Hoboken, N.J. To that end, following in the footsteps of countless other dreamers, she, too, flees to New York. There, she seeks out her absent mother, but instead finds a cipher (Julianne Moore), a screen star who clutches fictional babes to her breast but has no time for life’s real lost children. As undaunted and determined as Ben, Rose sets off again, entering a world thrumming with coincidences and complications.
Despite the distinct periods and palettes — Ben’s story unfolds in color, Rose’s in black and white — the story, the editing and the children’s deafness underscore that these two are deeply connected. The film’s mysteries include how and why they fit, and its satisfactions involve seeing where the scattered bread crumbs lead. How, for instance, an Oscar Wilde line in Ben’s room — “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars” — fits into the larger puzzle. And why, after Ben asks his mother about his father, the film shifts to a plaintive Rose, who’s looking at a movie-magazine ad trumpeting “Our Brightest Stars.” Both that  Wilde epigram and Rose’s film fandom are hints, clues in a story that eventually dovetails with Mr. Haynes’s interest in images and identity.
“Wonderstruck” is based on a hefty, generously illustrated children’s book by Brian Selznick, best known for “The Invention of Hugo Cabret.” Martin Scorsese turned that book into “Hugo,” a reverie about movie love that also features dead parents, a grave if pluckily resourceful child, many whirring yet connected parts and a preoccupation with the cinematic. The film version of “Wonderstruck” draws from much the same overflowing treasure-trove of ideas, although Mr. Haynes (like Mr. Scorsese) often feels most energized by the many different ways human beings — with cinematic sights and sounds, through wall shadows and painstaking miniatures — put the world in a box.
Both Rose and Ben fantasize about escaping their lives, but they need a little push, inspiration. Storytelling lies at the heart of “Wonderstruck” — its two children are effectively writing their way out of one reality and into another — and the film is chockablock with those boxed worlds, with imitations of life like dioramas, doll-size figurines, stuffed animals, illustrations and an ingenious paper city. Much like the cabinet of curiosities that Rose and Ben each discover, these representations point to new worlds and alternative realities. And, as they pile up, Mr. Haynes joins the story’s halves with craft and wit. Rose’s half isn’t just in black and white, it also emotionally and gesturally recalls a late-period silent film; Ben’s, by contrast, has the rough textures and bleeding colors that summon 1970s big-screen New York.
Although the film follows the novel fairly closely — Mr. Selznick wrote the script — it nevertheless is very much a Todd Haynes production. Its ideas feel pitched to an older audience, for one, and its emotional temperature is cooler than that of Mr. Selznick’s book, which is soon splashed in tears as Ben’s terror gives way to anguish about his mother. Mr. Haynes is happy to set a wolf after Ben in the woods, a jaggedly shot chase bathed in midnight blue, but he refrains from easy sentimentalism. (The director of photography is Ed Lachman.) As a filmmaker, Mr. Haynes prefers appealing to our heads over tugging at our hearts, and so for a while he keeps you at an intellectual remove.
Part of the pleasure of Mr. Haynes’s films — which include “I’m Not There” and “Carol” — is how he deploys intellectual distance as he plays with cinematic form, considers identity and upends clichés. Elsewhere, this can come across as dreary, even programmatic. Yet because Mr. Haynes also leads with his characters rather than his ideas, his films gather force until, at times with near-violent suddenness, they become devastatingly, skin-prickingly alive. In Mr. Haynes’s “Far From Heaven,” his combination of playfulness and seriousness translates into a homage to Sirkian melodrama that turns into a thrilling example of the very same. And, in “Wonderstruck,” a children’s story about finding your place in the world, in time becomes a Haynesian exploration of identity, desire and imagination.
“Wonderstruck” takes a while to find its groove, but it gets there. Mr. Haynes’s oscillation between the story’s two halves is gracefully handled (the editor is Affonso Gonçalves), but it can create a frustrating sense of narrative interruptus. That’s particularly true because it’s hard not to miss Rose when Ben is onscreen. Part of this has to do with the charming exoticism of her old-time world with its winking artifice and cinematic allusions. Ben’s half has its attractions, including his new pal (Jaden Michael) and the sun-blasted vision of a broiling New York summer. But it’s also the section in which the machinery of Mr. Selznick’s storytelling, with its mysticism and coincidences, creaks the loudest.
Mr. Selznick’s emphasis on wonder — represented by the story’s surfeit of enchantments and the near-miraculously fitted parts — can feel bullying, as if he were demanding delight instead of earning it. Yet even as he follows Mr. Selznick’s narrative lead, Mr. Haynes quietly and touchingly makes “Wonderstruck” his own because the wonder of the film isn’t in its story but in its telling. It’s in the expressive beauty of his images, the expansiveness of his ideas and the way he naturally, generously brings a once-upon-a-time girl and boy to life, allowing them to find themselves — in their willfulness, their heartbreaks and their imaginings — so that eventually they can find someone else.",0.999906377,Drama
